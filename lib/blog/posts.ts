Next.js 16.3.6 (Active LTS) and 15.5.26 (Maintenance LTS) upgrade upstream dependencies, including Satori, to address an issue that could lead to remote code execution. Version 15.5.26 includes related hardening, but Next.js 15.x is not affected by the remote code execution issue.",
      "The critical issue is remote code execution in the Node.js ImageResponse path in next/og (GHSA-vcvr-r3jv-pc5j), with related upstream advisory GHSA-wx4j-mvgx-mqwp for Satori. Next.js versions >=16.2.0 and <16.3.6 are affected. Improper escaping in SVG output from Satori could lead to RCE via other upstream dependencies; the fix upgrades those dependencies. Applications using the Edge ImageResponse implementation are not affected.",

A naive port of that skill into one prompt failed because models interpreted vague design language differently without real components nearby.",

The system has three parts: design.md guidance, a public stylesheet of classes and tokens (the agent documents class names; CSS loads in the browser so it does not fill model context), and an evaluation loop with deterministic checks plus human review. On matched trials, known mechanical failures fell from 91 without design.md to 39 with it (57% fewer). The sample is small, and pages can still have ship-blocking issues. Weekly feedback from Slack @design-agent (eve), GitHub, and Figma keeps the file current.",

Deployments built after July 17, 2026 already use the new shards; older deployments need a redeploy. The Build Output API contract is unchanged, and the change also saved about 16.6 seconds of redundant metadata upload work, making the deploy step about 10% faster overall.

      "On September 10, 2026, Alexi Robbins and Fredrika Lindh introduced Cursor Projects on the product blog, rolling out in beta. Projects take on larger bodies of work such as a feature, a migration, or a full app: they keep context over months, delegate to thousands of subagents, and can run recurring work without being prompted. You chat with a Projects coordinator that directs other agents rather than writing code itself. Runs are cloud by default on their own computer so closing a laptop does not stop the work, agents share context files, and subscriptions cover Slack, a schedule, and pull requests or CI.",
      "Cursor reports that new users merge 30% more pull requests, and that users who primarily use Projects merge six times as many — those figures are Cursor's own reporting. The post describes three patterns: feature work, migrations that span hundreds of pull requests, and ongoing gardening such as a design-system Project watching pull requests.",
      "The coordinator still depends on the Next.js and React you learn in Chapter 1.",

      "The post names CVE-2026-16231 (hbs async helper XSS, High); CVE-2026-77037, CVE-2026-77078, and CVE-2026-82333 (multer denial-of-service and resource issues, High); CVE-2026-15603 (morgan Unicode log forging, Medium); and CVE-2026-77063 (multer async fileFilter size-limit bypass, Low). The recommended action is to upgrade with npm update hbs multer morgan, or bump those packages.

      "On September 9, 2026, the React Team announced that React 19.3 is on npm. View Transitions and Fragment Refs, shared as experimental APIs last year, are stable in this release.",
      "The ViewTransition component animates elements as they enter, exit, move, or resize using the browser View Transition API. You can pass a ref to a Fragment to get a FragmentInstance for working with sibling DOM children as a group. A component can call use(browser()) to opt out of server-side rendering: the nearest Suspense fallback shows on the server, then the component renders after hydration. React 19.3 also passes Trusted Types values through without string coercion so a Content-Security-Policy require-trusted-types-for policy can protect injection sinks such as innerHTML.",

      "The through-line is architectural: do not treat Middleware or, in Next.js 16, proxy.ts as the only authorization layer. The guide repeats the recommended workaround — enforce authorization in server-side page, Route Handler, Server Action, or data-access logic — and notes that renaming middleware.ts to proxy.ts is not itself a security migration.",

      "Two issues are called out: unauthenticated remote code execution in the Image Optimization API when using AVIF (a vulnerability in libheif used by sharp; the patched releases disable AVIF optimization until an upstream fix lands), and a Windows-only unauthenticated RCE when an app uses both the Pages Router and the App Router without Cache Components. Linux and macOS are not affected by the Windows issue; the post says there is no known workaround for affected Windows-hosted apps.",

The official post highlights Instant Navigations — an opt-in suite that aims for SPA-like clicks without giving up the server-driven App Router — plus quieter wins you will feel in lab: lower next dev memory (up to 90% less RAM on long sessions), faster rebuilds via disk cache, TypeScript 7 type-checking during next build, and up to 22% more requests under load after App Router SSR switched to native Node streams.",
