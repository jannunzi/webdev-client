      <p>
        Kambaz is currently implemented entirely as a React
        application. Although various CRUD operations have been
        implemented to create, read, update, and delete courses and
        modules, these changes are not permanent and are lost when the
        browser is refreshed. To make the changes permanent, it is
        necessary to integrate the React user interface with a server
        that can access resources such as the file system, operating
        system, network, and database. In this section, server routes
        will be implemented to integrate the user interface with the
        server. In the next chapter, changes will be stored permanently
        in a MongoDB non-relational database.

      >
        <p>
          Previous chapters declared a Database component to
          consolidate all data files into a single access point.
          Ideally, the data should reside on the server side or within
          a dedicated database. In this chapter we are going to move
          the data to the server, with a transition to a database in
          the subsequent chapter. Begin by creating a folder named{" "}
          <code>Kambaz</code>{" "}at the root of the Node.js project.
          Inside the Kambaz folder, create a Database directory and
          copy all JSON files from the React project — the same arrays
          you exported in{" "}
          <SectionLink to="3.9.2" />. Then change the file extensions
          of the JSON files to JavaScript, for example, rename{" "}
          <code>users.json</code>{" "}to{" "}
          <code>users.js</code>{" "}and{" "}
          <code>courses.json</code>{" "}to{" "}
          <code>courses.js</code>. At the top of each newly converted
          JavaScript file, include an{" "}
          <code>export default</code>{" "}statement, as shown below.

          The Data Access Object (DAO) design pattern organizes data
          access by grouping it based on data types or collections. The
          following <code>Kambaz/Users/dao.js</code>{" "}file implements
          various CRUD operations for handling the users array in the

          <p>
            DAOs provide an interface between an application and
            low-level database access, offering a high-level API to the
            rest of the application while abstracting the details and
            idiosyncrasies of using a particular database vendor.
            Similarly, routes create an interface between the HTTP
            network layer and the JavaScript object and function layer
            by transforming a stream of bits from a network connection
            request into a set of objects, maps, and function event
            handlers that are part of the client/server architecture in
            a multi-tiered application.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Node.js server uses routes to integrate with the user
            interface and implements DAOs to communicate with the
            Database. The server functions between these two layers,
            which is why it is often called the middle tier in a
            multi-tiered application. The following routes expose the
            database operations through a RESTful API, and the
            implementation of each function will be covered in the
            following sections. This chapter uses the Database
            component implemented in{" "}
            <code>Kambaz/Database/index.js</code>. Later chapters will
            refactor this by using an actual database.

          Previous chapters implemented CRUD operations to create,

          These changes were transient and were lost when users

          a RESTful Web API to integrate the Dashboard and Courses

        <p>
          Now let us do the same thing we did for the courses, but for
          the modules. We will need routes that deal with the modules
          similar to the operations we implemented for the courses. We
          will need to implement all the basic CRUD operations: create
          modules, read/retrieve modules, update modules and delete
          modules. The main difference will be that modules exist
          within the context of a particular course. Each course has a
          different set of modules, so the routes will need to take
          into account the course ID for which the modules we are
          operating on. Nested in the UI, flat on the server:{" "}
          <code>GET/POST /api/courses/:courseId/modules</code>,{" "}
          <code>PUT/DELETE /api/modules/:moduleId</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The PDF updated a Redux{" "}
          <code>modulesReducer</code>{" "}with{" "}
          <code>setModules</code>. This book&apos;s Modules screen
          fetches into component state with the same client functions;
          Chapter 4&apos;s Zustand module store is no longer the
          source of truth once Express is wired.
