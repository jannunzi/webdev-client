        <p>
          Currently we are integrating the React user interface with a
          Node server, both running locally on our development
          computers, but ultimately these will both be running on
          remote servers. Let us configure the local environment so
          that it will be easy later on to configure our source code to
          run in any environment. There are two environments to
          consider: the local development environment and the remote
          production environment. The local development environment
          consists of our computer where we do our development running
          two Node servers, one hosting the React user interface Web
          application, and the other hosting the Express HTTP server.
          The remote production environments will consist of the React
          user interface running on Vercel, and the Express HTTP server
          running on Render.com, Heroku, or AWS (your choice).
        </p>
        <p>
          Environments can be configured with environment variables
          declared in your operating system or as environment files in
          your project. Environment files are named{" "}
          <code>.env</code>{" "}(with a leading period) and can be
          defined for each environment by appending{" "}
          <code>.development</code>{" "}for the local development
          environment, <code>.test</code>{" "}for the test environment,
          and <code>.production</code>{" "}for the production
          environment. Instead of hardcoding{" "}
          <code>http://localhost:4000</code>{" "}everywhere in our source
          code, instead, declare an environment variable in the local
          environment file as shown below. Create the{" "}
          <code>.env.development</code>{" "}file at the root of your
          React project and copy the following content.
        </p>
        <CodeBlock language="shell">{`NEXT_PUBLIC_HTTP_SERVER=http://localhost:4000`}</CodeBlock>
        <p>
          In Next.js React projects, all environment variables that
          must reach the browser start with{" "}
          <OfficialLink href="https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables">
            <code>NEXT_PUBLIC_</code>
          </OfficialLink>{" "}
          so that they are exported to client components. Each line
          declares a variable, followed by an equal sign, followed by
          the value of the variable. Make sure not to use extra spaces
          or unnecessary extra characters such as quotes, commas, or
          colons. Every time a new variable is added, removed, or
          changed in an environment file, the React user interface Web
          application needs to be restarted. Environment variables can
          be accessed from the React source code through the global{" "}
          <code>process</code>{" "}object, in its{" "}
          <code>env</code>{" "}property. For instance, to access the
          value of{" "}
          <code>NEXT_PUBLIC_HTTP_SERVER</code>{" "}declared above, use{" "}
          <code>process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_HTTP_SERVER</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The PDF name is{" "}
          <code>NEXT_PUBLIC_HTTP_SERVER</code>. This book wraps it in{" "}
          <code>httpServer()</code>{" "}so every Express LiveDemo uses
          the same client code — locally{" "}
          <code>http://localhost:4000</code>, and later whatever origin
          you set for deploy. Unset, the helper still points at the
          companion on 4000, which is enough for every LiveDemo in this
          chapter. <SectionLink to="5.5" />{" "}is when you point the
          same helper at a deployed origin. Do not hard-code the host
          in screens.

          To practice declaring and using environment variables, create
          the <code>Environment</code>{" "}component below and import it
          from the Lab 5 page. Confirm the browser displays the remote
          server URL as shown. Make sure the URL to the remote server
          is never used as a literal in the React source code; instead
          prefer the environment variable. Replace the{" "}
          <code>http://localhost:4000</code>{" "}in the previous Welcome
          hyperlink with the helper (or a constant assigned from{" "}
          <code>process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_HTTP_SERVER</code>). Confirm
          that the Welcome hyperlink still works.

        <p>
          Let us explore how we can integrate the React user interface
          with the Node server by sending information to the server
          from the browser. There are three ways to send information to
          the server:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Path parameters</strong> — parameters are encoded
            as segments of the path itself, e.g.,{" "}
            <code>/lab5/add/2/5</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Query parameters</strong> — parameters are encoded
            as name value pairs in the query string after the{" "}
            <code>?</code>{" "}character at the end of a URL, e.g.,{" "}
            <code>/lab5/add?a=2&amp;b=5</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Request body</strong> — data is sent as a string
            representation of data encoded in some format such as XML
            or JSON containing properties and their values, e.g.,{" "}
            <code>{`{a: 2, b: 5}`}</code>.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          We will explore the first two in this section, and address

        >
          <p>
            React applications can pass data to servers by embedding it
            in a URL path as path parameters part of a URL. For
            instance the last two integers — 2 and 4 — at the end of
            the following URL can be parsed by a corresponding matching
            route on the server, add the two integers, and respond with
            the result of 6:{" "}
            <code>/lab5/add/2/4</code>. The following route
            declarations can parse path parameters{" "}
            <code>a</code>{" "}and{" "}
            <code>b</code>{" "}encoded in paths{" "}
            <code>/lab5/add/:a/:b</code>{" "}and{" "}
            <code>/lab5/subtract/:a/:b</code>. In{" "}
            <code>PathParameters.js</code>, implement the routes below
            and import it in{" "}
            <code>Lab5/index.js</code>. On your own create routes{" "}
            <code>/lab5/multiply/:a/:b</code>{" "}and{" "}
            <code>/lab5/divide/:a/:b</code>{" "}that calculate the
            arithmetic multiplication and division.
          </p>
          <p>
            Retrieve path parameters as strings from{" "}
            <code>req.params</code>, parse them as integers, then send
            the result as a <em>string</em>. Do not send a bare
            integer: browsers and some HTTP clients treat a numeric
            body as a status code, so{" "}
            <code>res.send(6)</code>{" "}can look like a 6 status
            instead of the text six. Convert with{" "}

            Meanwhile, in the React Web application, let us create a
            React component to test the new routes from our Web
            application. Web applications that interact with server
            applications are often referred to as client applications
            since they are the client in an application built using a
            client/server architecture. Create the component below that
            declares state variables{" "}
            <code>a</code>{" "}and{" "}
            <code>b</code>, encodes the values in hyperlinks, and when
            you click them, the server responds with the addition or
            subtraction of the parameters. Note that the name of the
            component is arbitrary. The fact that it is called the same
            as the routes in the server is a coincidence. It also
            helps us keep track of which UI components on the client
            are related to the server resources. On your own, create
            links that invoke the multiply and divide routes you
            implemented earlier. Import the new component in your Lab
            5 component and confirm that clicking the links generates
            the expected response. Use Tailwind inputs and colored
            buttons — the PDF used Bootstrap{" "}
            <code>FormControl</code>{" "}and{" "}
            <code>btn-primary</code>; the live sample uses rounded

          <p>
            React applications can also send data to servers by
            encoding it as a query string after the question mark
            character (<code>?</code>) at the end of a URL. A query
            string consists of a list of name value pairs separated by
            the ampersand character (
            <code>&amp;</code>) as shown below:{" "}
            <code>/lab5/calculator?operation=add&amp;a=2&amp;b=4</code>.
            In <code>Lab5/QueryParameters.js</code>, in your server
            application, create a route that can parse an operation and
            its parameters <code>a</code>{" "}and{" "}
            <code>b</code>. If the operation is add the route responds
            with the addition of the parameters. If the operation is
            subtract, the route responds with the subtraction of the
            parameters. On your own, also handle operations multiply
            and divide. Import{" "}
            <code>QueryParameters.js</code>{" "}in{" "}
            <code>Lab5/index.js</code>{" "}and pass it a reference of{" "}
            <code>app</code>. Read the values from{" "}
            <code>req.query</code>{" "}— they arrive as strings, the
            same as path parameters — and send the result as a string
            so the browser does not treat it as a status code.

          The examples so far have demonstrated working with integers

          Now let us work with something a little more challenging.
          Create an array of objects and explore how to retrieve, add,
          remove, and update the array. Working with a collection of
          objects requires a general set of operations often referred
          to as{" "}
          <strong>CRUD</strong>{" "}or create, read, update, and
          delete. These operations capture common interactions with
          any collection of data such as creating and adding new
          instances to the collection, reading or retrieving items in a
          collection, updating or modifying items in a collection, and
          deleting or removing items from a collection. Same process
          memory as the assignment object — reboot resets the seed.

          <p>
            Let us first create the array data structure containing
            several todo objects. The most common integration between a
            client and server application is for a client application
            to retrieve all the instances of some collection. To
            illustrate this, create a route that retrieves the array of
            todo objects as shown below. Import the new route to{" "}
            <code>Lab5/index.js</code>. Point the browser to{" "}
            <code>http://localhost:4000/lab5/todos</code>{" "}and confirm

            Another common operation is to retrieve a particular item
            from an array by its primary key, e.g., its ID property.
            The convention is to encode the ID of the item of interest
            as a path parameter. Note that we could have chosen to
            encode the ID as a query parameter instead, but it is best
            practice to encode identifiers in the path instead. The
            example below parses the ID as a path parameter, finds the
            corresponding item, and responds with the item. Add a
            hyperlink to the React component to test retrieving an
            item from the array by its primary key. Confirm that you
            can type the ID in the UI and clicking the hyperlink

        >
          <p>
            The convention for retrieving a particular item from a
            collection is to encode the item&apos;s ID as a path
            parameter, e.g.,{" "}
            <code>/todos/123</code>. Another convention is that if the
            primary key is not provided, then the interpretation is
            that we want the entire collection of items, e.g.,{" "}
            <code>/todos</code>. We can also want to retrieve items by
            some other criteria other than the item&apos;s ID such as
            the item&apos;s title or completed properties. The best
            practice in this case is to use query strings instead of
            path parameters when filtering items by properties other
            than the primary key, e.g.,{" "}
            <code>/todos?completed=true</code>. The example below
            refactors <code>/lab5/todos</code>{" "}to handle the case
            when we want to filter the array by the completed query
            parameter. Add a hyperlink to the React component to test

            The examples we have seen so far have illustrated various
            read operations in our exploration of possible CRUD
            operations. Let us now take a look at the create operation.
            The example below demonstrates a route that creates a new
            item in the array and responds with the array now
            containing the new item. Note that it is implemented{" "}
            <em>before</em>{" "}the{" "}
            <code>/lab5/todos/:id</code>{" "}route, otherwise the{" "}
            <code>:id</code>{" "}path parameter would interpret the
            word <code>create</code>{" "}in{" "}
            <code>/lab5/todos/create</code>{" "}as an ID, which would
            certainly create an error trying to parse it as an integer.
            Also note that the new todo creates default values
            including a unique identifier field{" "}
            <code>id</code>{" "}based on a timestamp. Eventually
            primary keys will be handled by a database later in the
            course. Finally note that the response consists of the
            entire todos array, which is convenient for us for now, but
            a more common implementation would be to respond with only{" "}
            <code>newTodo</code>.
          </p>

            Add a Create Todo hyperlink to the{" "}

            Next let us consider the delete operation in the CRUD
            family of operations. The convention is to encode the ID of
            the item to delete as a path parameter as shown below. We
            search for the item in the set of items and remove it.
            Typically we would respond with a status of success or
            failure, but for now we are responding with all the todos.
            To test the new route, create a link that encodes the
            todo&apos;s ID in a hyperlink to delete the corresponding
            item. We will use the todo state variable created earlier
            to type the ID of the item we want to remove. Confirm that
            you can type the ID of an item, click the hyperlink, and
            that the corresponding item is removed from the array.

            search for the item in the set of items and update it.

          The exercises explored so far sent data encoded in the URL of
          hyperlinks. The links navigated to a separate browser window
          that displayed the server response. Even though we were able
          to send data to the server and affect changes to the server
          data, we have not considered how those changes can affect the
          user interface. Let us explore how to fully integrate the
          user interface with the server by sending and receiving HTTP
          requests and responses asynchronously.

            applications can send and retrieve HTTP requests and
            responses asynchronously from client JavaScript
            applications to a remote HTTP server. Although XML was the
            original data format in AJAX, JSON has overtaken as the
            dominant data format in modern Web applications, but the
            AJAX label still applies nevertheless.{" "}

            is a popular JavaScript library that React user interface

            Let us use the same server routes implemented in earlier
            exercises, but instead of clicking on hyperlinks in the
            React client, we will use axios to programmatically invoke
            the URLs, giving us a chance to capture and handle the
            responses from the server and render the response in the
            user interface. The code below illustrates how to use the
            axios library to send an asynchronous request to the
            server and then capture the response in the user
            interface, without navigating to the URL, away from the
            current window. The{" "}

            <code>axios.get()</code>{" "}to asynchronously send a
            request to the server, and returns the response from the
            server. Create the component below and import it in the
            Lab 5 component. Open the Web Dev Tools and confirm that
            clicking the Fetch Welcome button causes a CORS error the

            Servers and browsers limit JavaScript programs to only be
            able to communicate with the servers from where they are
            downloaded. Since our React application is running locally
            from <code>localhost:3000</code>, then they would only be
            able to communicate back to a server running on{" "}
            <code>localhost:3000</code>, but our server is running on{" "}
            <code>localhost:4000</code>, so when our JavaScript
            components try to communicate with{" "}
            <code>localhost:4000</code>, the browser considers a
            different origin as a security risk, stops the
            communication, and throws a{" "}
            <OfficialLink href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS">

          </p>
          <p>
            CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, which
            governs the policies and mechanisms of how various
            resources can be shared across different domains or
            origins. Browsers enforce CORS policies by first checking
            with the server if they are okay with receiving requests
            from different domains. If the server responds
            affirmatively, then browsers let the requests go through,
            otherwise they will consider the attempt as a violation of
            CORS security policy, abort the request, and throw the
            exception. We can configure the CORS security policies by
            installing the cors Node.js library as shown below.

            The current HttpClient implementation makes a request to
            the server from the component itself using the axios
            library. In addition to retrieving (or reading) data from
            the server, there will be other CRUD operations to create,
            update, and delete needed to interact with the server.
            Instead of implementing these in a React component, it is
            better to implement these in a reusable client library that
            can be shared across several user interface components.
            Move the <code>axios.get()</code>{" "}in HttpClient to a
            separate file called{" "}

        <p>
          The exercises so far have sent data to the server as path
          and query parameters. This approach is limited to the
          maximum length of the URL string, and only string data
          types. Another concern is that data in the URL is sent over
          a network in clear text, so anyone snooping around between
          the client and server can see the data as plain text which
          is not a good option for exchanging sensitive information
          such as passwords and other personal data. A better approach
          is to encode the data as JSON in the HTTP request body which
          allows for arbitrarily large amounts of data as well as
          secure data encryption. To enable the server to parse JSON
          data from the request body, add the following{" "}
          <code>app.use()</code>{" "}statement in{" "}
          <code>index.js</code>. Make sure that it is implemented
          right after the CORS configuration statement. Now JSON data
          coming from the client is available in the request body in
          the <code>request.body</code>{" "}property in the server
          routes.

          The hyperlinks and{" "}
          <code>axios.get()</code>{" "}in the exercises so far have
          sent data to the server using the HTTP GET method or verb.
          HTTP defines several other HTTP methods or verbs including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>GET</strong> — for retrieving data, but we have
            been also misusing it for creating, modifying and deleting
            data on the server. We will start using it properly only
            for retrieving data.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>POST</strong> — for creating new data typically
            embedded in the HTTP body
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>PUT</strong> — for modifying existing data where
            updates are typically embedded in the HTTP body
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>DELETE</strong> — for removing existing data
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>OPTIONS</strong> — for retrieving allowed
            operations. Used to figure out if CORS policy allows
            communication with the other methods such as GET, POST,
            PUT and DELETE
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The GET method, as the name suggests, is meant for only
          getting data from the server. We have been misusing it to
          implement routes that also create, update, and delete data
          on the server. We did this mostly for academic purposes
          since it is the easiest HTTP method to work with. From now
          on we will use the proper HTTP method for the right purpose.
          Keep the older GET create/delete routes so earlier links
          still work.

          <p>
            To illustrate using the HTTP POST method, let us
            re-implement the route that creates new todos as shown
            below. The HTTP POST method takes the role of the verb
            meaning create. Add the new{" "}
            <code>app.post</code>{" "}implementation. Do not remove the
            old GET version so we do not break the other lab
            exercises. Note how the new implementation grabs the
            posted JSON data from{" "}
            <code>req.body</code>{" "}and uses it to define{" "}
            <code>newTodo</code>. Also note that this version does
            not respond with the entire todos array and instead only
            responds with the newly created todo object instance. This
            is more reasonable since arrays can potentially be large
            and it would be expensive to transfer such large data
            structures over a network, especially if the client UI
            already has most of this data already displayed.

            Back in the user interface, add a new{" "}

            time contains the todo instance added to the todos array

          <p>
            Now that we have axios we can implement a better version
            of the remove operation. The current{" "}
            <code>removeTodo</code>{" "}implementation uses the HTTP GET
            method to request the server to remove data. The HTTP
            DELETE method is specifically suited for removing data
            from remote servers. In the server project, implement a
            better version of the delete operation as shown below. The
            new implementation uses the HTTP DELETE method declared in{" "}
            <code>app.delete()</code>{" "}which is distinct from{" "}
            <code>app.get()</code>{" "}for which we do not need the
            trailing <code>/delete</code>{" "}at the end of the URL.
            Removing the element from the array is the same either
            way. Although we could again respond with the entire array
            of surviving todos, it is better to just respond with a
            success status and let the user interface update its state
            variable. This reduces unnecessary data communication
            between the client and server.

          <p>
            In the React project create a new client function called{" "}

            <code>axios.delete</code>{" "}instead of{" "}
            <code>axios.get</code>{" "}so that it matches the
            server&apos;s <code>app.delete</code>{" "}as well as the URL

            another delete button to try this new{" "}

            different icon, say an X so as to not confuse it with the
            trash. Note that the new implementation ignores the
            response from the server and instead filters the removed
            todo from the local state variable. This is fine for now,
            but the operation is too optimistic assuming the server
            successfully deleted the item from the array and updating
            the user interface without confirmation. Later we will
            deal with errors from the server to make sure the local
            state variable in the user interface is in synch with the
            remote array on the server.

            Use HTTP PUT to reimplement the route that updates an item
            in an array as shown below. The route replaces the todo
            item whose ID matches the id path parameter with a
            combination of the original todo object and properties in
            the <code>req.body</code>. This overrides any properties
            in the original todo object with matching properties in

            with a simple OK status code of 200. This is more
            reasonable since there is no need to respond with an
            entire array since the user interface already has the
            array cached in the browser and it can just update the
            item in the todos state variable.

            The exercises so far have been very optimistic when
            interacting with the server, but it is good practice to
            handle edge cases and the unforeseen. In this section we
            are going to add error handling to some of the routes and
            user interface. For instance, the exercise below throws
            exceptions if the items being deleted or updated do not
            actually exist. Errors are reported by the server as
            status codes, where 404 is the infamous NOT FOUND error.
            Additionally a JSON object can be sent back as part of the
            response that can be used by user interfaces to better
            inform the user of what went wrong.

          <p>
            In the user interface we can catch the errors by wrapping
            the request in a <code>try</code>/<code>catch</code>{" "}
            clause as shown below. If the request fails with an HTTP
            error response, then the body of the try block is aborted
            and the body of the catch clause executes instead. The
            exercise below declares an{" "}
            <code>errorMessage</code>{" "}state variable that we
            populate with the error from the server if an error
            occurs. The error is rendered as a red alert box using
            Tailwind — the PDF used Bootstrap{" "}
            <code>alert-danger</code>; the live sample uses{" "}
            <code>bg-red-100</code>{" "}and{" "}
            <code>text-red-800</code>. To test, remove an item using
            the{" "}
            <code>http://localhost:4000/lab5/todos/:id/delete</code>{" "}
            GET route and then try to update or delete the same item
            using the user interface. Confirm you get an error if you
            try to delete or update a todo that does not exist.
