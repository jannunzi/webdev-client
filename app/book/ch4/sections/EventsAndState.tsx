        title="4.2.1 Handling User Events"
      >
        <p>
          Users interact with the Web application user interface by
          clicking their mouse, typing at their keyboards, and, on mobile
          devices, tapping, swiping, and pinching at the screen. As they
          interact with the graphical user interface, they generate a
          stream of <strong>events</strong> that need to be handled by
          interpreting the user intent, modifying the Web application
          state, and rerendering the user interface to reflect the new
          state so the user can see that their actions are having the
          intended effect. HTML and CSS describe how a screen looks; the
          event stream describes what the user did. A click, a keystroke,
          and a form submit are events, and React listens with attributes
          such as <code>onClick</code>{" "}and <code>onChange</code>. The
          next few sections consider the various types of events users
          generate and how they can be handled. The next three
          subsections cover click events, passing data when handling
          events, and passing functions as parameters.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <code>onClick</code>{" "}attribute declares a function that
          handles clicks. Those listeners only run in the browser, so the
          file that uses them starts with{" "}
          <code>&quot;use client&quot;</code> — the same directive{" "}
          <SectionLink to="3.6.1" />{" "}introduced for pathname-aware
          components. In Next.js, JavaScript files execute on the server
          by default and cannot interact with the user. User interaction
          such as mouse clicks, keyboard typing, and dialog windows all
          need to talk to the browser and the computer hardware, and
          therefore need to run on the client. Files tagged with{" "}
          <code>&quot;use client&quot;</code>{" "}are not executed on the
          server for that interaction; they are sent to the browser to
          execute there. To practice handling a click event, create the{" "}
          <code>ClickEvent</code>{" "}component below and import it from
          the Lab 4 page. Confirm the browser displays as shown and that
          clicking the button opens an alert.

const hello = () => {
  alert("Hello World!");

        <p>
          The handler is a function reference:{" "}
          <code>{`onClick={hello}`}</code>, not{" "}
          <code>{`onClick={hello()}`}</code>. Parentheses would call{" "}
          <code>hello</code>{" "}while React is rendering, before anyone
          clicks, and the alert would fire as soon as the page loaded.
          Passing the function by name tells React to invoke it later,
          when the click actually happens. The PDF also shows wrapping
          several statements in an arrow when one click should call more
          than one function —{" "}
          <code>{`onClick={() => { hello(); lifeIs("Great!"); }}`}</code>{" "}
          — which you will use as soon as a handler needs an argument or
          more than one line of code. Click the button and confirm an
          alert appears:

      >
        <p>
          When handling an event, sometimes we need to pass parameters to
          the function that handles the event — which item to delete,
          which message to show, which two numbers to add. Write a
          function that takes those arguments, then wrap the call in a
          closure, an arrow function that React can invoke later, so the
          argument is not evaluated during render. If you do not wrap the
          function call inside a closure, you risk creating an infinite
          loop or at least running the handler on every render:{" "}
          <code>{`onClick={add(2, 3)}`}</code>{" "}calls{" "}
          <code>add</code>{" "}immediately and passes its return value,
          which is <code>undefined</code>, to <code>onClick</code>. To
          practice passing data when handling events, create the{" "}
          <code>PassingDataOnEvent</code>{" "}component below and import it
          from the Lab 4 page. Confirm the browser displays as shown.

          The first button still uses a function reference because{" "}

          wraps <code>lifeIs(&quot;Life is Good!&quot;)</code>{" "}in an
          arrow so the string is only passed when the user clicks. Use
          that arrow syntax, and not{" "}

          In JavaScript, functions can be treated as any other constant or
          variable, including passing them as parameters to other
          functions. A child can invoke behavior the parent owns if the
          parent passes the function as a prop. The example below passes
          function <code>sayHello</code>{" "}to component{" "}
          <code>PassingFunctions</code>. When the button is clicked,{" "}
          <code>sayHello</code>{" "}is invoked. That is why the Lab 4 page
          itself is a Client Component: the parent creates the function in
          the browser and hands the child a reference. To practice passing
          functions as parameters, create the{" "}
          <code>PassingFunctions</code>{" "}component below, declare a{" "}
          <code>sayHello</code>{" "}callback on the Lab 4 page, pass it as{" "}
          <code>{`theFunction={sayHello}`}</code>, and confirm it works
          as expected.

          Web applications implemented with React can be considered as a
          set of functions that transform a set of data structures into an
          equivalent user interface. The collection of data structures and
          values is often referred to as an application state. So far we
          have explored React applications that transform a static data
          set into a static user interface. We will now consider how the
          state can change over time as users interact with the user
          interface and how those state changes can be represented on the
          screen. Users interact with an application by clicking,
          dragging, and typing, filling out forms, clicking buttons, and
          scrolling through data. As they interact they create a stream of
          events that can be handled by a set of event-handling functions,
          often referred to as controllers. Controllers handle user events
          and convert them into changes in the application&apos;s state.
          Applications render those state changes into corresponding
          changes in the user interface. In Web applications, user
          interface changes consist of changes to the{" "}
          <OfficialLink href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/">
            DOM
          </OfficialLink>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          Updating the DOM with JavaScript is slow and can degrade the
          performance of Web applications. React optimizes the process by
          creating a <strong>virtual DOM</strong>, a more compact and
          efficient version of the real DOM. When React renders something
          on the screen, it first updates the virtual DOM, and then
          converts these changes into updates to the actual DOM. To avoid
          unnecessary and slow updates, React only updates the real DOM if
          there have been changes to the virtual DOM. We can participate
          in this process of state change and DOM updates by using the{" "}
          <OfficialLink href="https://react.dev/reference/react/useState">
            useState
          </OfficialLink>{" "}
          hook. The hook is used to declare state variables that we want
          to affect the DOM rendering. The next subsections declare
          integer, boolean, string, date, object, and array state
          variables with that same hook. The syntax of the hook is a
          pair:
        </p>
        <CodeBlock language="tsx">{`const [stateVariable, setStateVariable] = useState(initialStateValue);`}</CodeBlock>
        <p>
          The <code>useState</code>{" "}hook takes as argument the initial
          value of a state variable and returns an array whose first item
          is the initialized state variable and whose second item is a
          mutator function that allows updating it. The array destructor
          syntax is commonly used to bind these items to local constants
          as shown above. The mutator function not only changes the value
          of the state variable, but it also notifies React that it should
          check if the state has caused changes to the virtual DOM and
          therefore make changes to the actual DOM. A plain{" "}
          <code>let</code>{" "}can change in memory and the heading will
          not move, because React does not know to paint again. To
          illustrate the point of the virtual DOM and how changes in
          state affect the actual DOM, create{" "}
          <code>CounterBroken.tsx</code>{" "}first so the failure is
          visible. A <code>count</code>{" "}variable is initialized and
          rendered on the screen. Buttons Up and Down update the variable
          in memory, but the heading stays at 7 because as far as React is
          concerned there have been no changes to the virtual DOM.
        </p>

          For the DOM to be updated as expected, we need to tell React
          that changes to a particular variable are indeed relevant to
          changes in the DOM. To do this, use the{" "}
          <code>useState</code>{" "}hook to declare the state variable, and
          update it using the mutator function. Calling the setter queues
          a new render with the new value. Implement the{" "}
          <code>Counter</code>{" "}component below, import it in Lab 4, and
          confirm it works as expected. Do the same with the rest of the
          exercises that follow.

          Click Up and Down and confirm the heading changes. The mutator
          is called with the next integer, React compares the virtual DOM
          to the previous tree, and the heading is the part that actually
          writes to the real DOM. That is the same integer you will
          rebuild with Context, Zustand, and Redux so the three APIs stay

          The <code>useState</code>{" "}hook works with all JavaScript data
          types and structures including booleans, integers, strings,
          numbers, arrays, and objects. The exercise below illustrates
          using the hook with boolean state variables. The variable is
          used to hide or show a DIV as well as render a checkbox as
          checked or not. Also note the use of <code>onChange</code>{" "}
          on the checkbox to set the value of the state variable: bind{" "}
          <code>checked</code>{" "}to the current boolean and toggle it

        <p>
          The <code>ObjectStateVariable</code>{" "}component demonstrates
          how to work with object state variables. We declare a{" "}
          <code>person</code>{" "}object state variable with initial
          property values <code>name</code>{" "}and <code>age</code>. The
          object is rendered on the screen using{" "}
          <code>JSON.stringify</code>{" "}so you can see the changes in
          real time. Two input fields are initialized to the object&apos;s{" "}
          <code>person.name</code>{" "}string property and the object&apos;s{" "}
          <code>person.age</code>{" "}number property. As the user types,
          the <code>onChange</code>{" "}attribute updates the object&apos;s
          property using the <code>setPerson</code>{" "}mutator. The object
          is updated by creating a new object copied from the previous
          value using the spread operator{" "}
          <code>{`{ ...person }`}</code>, and then overriding the{" "}
          <code>name</code>{" "}or <code>age</code>{" "}property with the
          new <code>target.value</code>. When the state value is an
          object, replace it with a new one rather than editing the old
          one in place. Writing{" "}
          <code>person.name = e.target.value</code>{" "}would edit the old
          object in place, and React may skip the render because the
          reference did not change. To practice with object state, create

      >
        <p>
          The <code>ArrayStateVariable</code>{" "}component demonstrates
          how to work with array state variables. An array of integers is
          declared as a state variable, and functions{" "}
          <code>addElement</code>{" "}and <code>deleteElement</code>{" "}
          add and remove elements. We render the array as a map of line
          items in an unordered list. We render the array&apos;s value and
          a Delete button for each element. Clicking Delete calls{" "}
          <code>deleteElement</code>{" "}and passes the index of the
          element we want to remove. That function computes a new array
          filtering out the element by its position and updates the state
          variable to contain a new array without the element we filtered
          out. Clicking Add Element invokes{" "}
          <code>addElement</code>, which computes a new array with a copy
          of the previous array spread at the beginning and a new random
          element at the end. Arrays follow the same
          replace-don&apos;t-mutate rule as objects: compute a new array,
          append with spread, and remove with <code>filter</code>. The
          Delete button receives the index through an arrow so it is not
          called during render. To practice with array state, create the{" "}
          <code>ArrayStateVariable</code>{" "}component below, import it
