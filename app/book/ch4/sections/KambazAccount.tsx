        <p>
          The Account screens provide users access to their personal
          information and all related data such as courses they are
          enrolled in and courses they might be teaching. Users use the
          Sign in screen to identify themselves and access their Profile
          screen to view their personal information. This section
          describes refactoring the Sign in and Profile screens to
          confirm a user&apos;s identity and display their personal
          information. Account Navigation should hide Sign in and Sign
          up once someone is signed in, and hide Profile when nobody is.
        </p>
        <p>
          Put the current user in React Context, wrapped around the
          Kambaz layout, so Dashboard, Account, and Profile all read the
          same value. We could have used Zustand here as well — and we
          will for courses and modules — but who is signed in changes
          rarely, so Context is a fair fit, and it lets you practice the
          provider you already built in the lab. Local{" "}
          <code>useState</code>{" "}plus Zustand for everything shared
          would have worked, and would even have been simpler. The PDF
          kept <code>currentUser</code>{" "}in an account reducer next to
          the course and module lists; this book uses{" "}
          <code>AccountContext</code>{" "}for that one value and leaves
          the lists in Zustand.
        </p>

          <p>
            Implement an account context to keep track of the currently
            signed-in user and share it across the entire application.
            The pattern is a context, a provider that holds{" "}
            <code>currentUser</code>{" "}in <code>useState</code>, and a
            hook that throws if you forget the provider — the same shape
            as the lab counter in <SectionLink to="4.4" />. Seed the
            type from <code>users.json</code>{" "}so the signed-in object
            has the same fields the Profile form will display. To
            practice the context, create{" "}
            <code>app/(kambaz)/account/AccountContext.tsx</code>{" "}as
            shown below. Confirm the file compiles and that{" "}
            <code>currentUser</code>{" "}starts as{" "}
            <code>null</code>{" "}until someone signs in.

          <p>
            <code>setCurrentUser</code>{" "}is the only writer. Sign in
            will pass a user from <code>users.json</code>. Sign out will
            pass <code>null</code>. The hook throws if a screen calls it
            outside the provider so you notice a missing wrap immediately

            Component so the fields can be controlled and the click

            Following <code>modulesStore.ts</code>{" "}as an example, create{" "}
            <code>app/(kambaz)/store/assignmentsStore.ts</code>{" "}
            initialized with the assignments from{" "}

            such as <code>addAssignment</code>,{" "}
            <code>deleteAssignment</code>,{" "}
            <code>updateAssignment</code>, and any other functions you
            need — for example a helper that finds one assignment by{" "}
            <code>_id</code>{" "}when the editor opens. Generate new ids
            with <code>crypto.randomUUID()</code>{" "}the same way the
            courses and modules stores do. Confirm the store compiles
            and that the Assignments page can filter the array by the
            current course before you wire Save and Delete.

            Refactor your Assignments screen so that creating a row
            goes through the editor instead of a dialog. Clicking the +
            Assignment button should navigate to the Assignment Editor,
            not append an empty title on the list. The editor should
            allow editing at least the name, description, points, due
            date, available-from date, and available-until date — the
            same fields <SectionLink to="3.9.8.1" />{" "}already displayed
            from JSON. Clicking Save creates the new assignment, adds
            it to the assignments array in the Zustand store, and
            navigates back to the Assignments screen, which must now
            contain the newly created assignment. Clicking Cancel does
            not create the new assignment and navigates back to the
            Assignments screen without the new row. Confirm in the
            browser that Save increases the list by one and that Cancel
            leaves the list unchanged.

            Refactor the Assignment Editor so that clicking an
            assignment on the list navigates to the editor and displays
            that assignment&apos;s name, description, points, due date,
            available-from date, and available-until date. The editor
            should allow editing those same fields for the corresponding
            assignment. Clicking Save updates the assignment&apos;s
            fields in the store and navigates back to the Assignments
            screen with the updated values. Clicking Cancel does not
            update the assignment and navigates back to the list, which
            shows the assignments unchanged. Confirm you can open two
            different assignments and see different titles, then change
            one title, Save, and see only that row update.

            Refactor the Assignments list using the modules trash can
            as a model: add a Delete button or trash icon to the right
            of each assignment. Clicking Delete on an assignment should
            pop up a dialog asking whether you are sure you want to
            remove the assignment. Clicking Yes or Ok dismisses the
            dialog, removes the assignment from the store, and updates
            the Assignments screen without the deleted row. Clicking No
            or Cancel dismisses the dialog without removing the
            assignment. Confirm a delete that you confirm removes the
            row and that a delete you cancel leaves the title in place.
            Filter every list and every editor save by the current{" "}
            <code>cid</code>{" "}so an assignment created in RS101 does
            not appear in RS102.

          Currently the Dashboard allows faculty to Add, Delete, Edit,
          and Update courses, as well as navigate to the course content.
          Other users currently only see the courses they are enrolled
          in. Refactor Dashboard so that there is a new blue Enrollments
          button at the top right of the screen. Clicking Enrollments
          displays all the courses. Clicking it again only shows the
          courses the user is enrolled in. The PDF used a Redux
          enrollment list for the same toggle; implement{" "}
          <code>app/(kambaz)/store/enrollmentsStore.ts</code>{" "}seeded
          from <code>enrollments.json</code>{" "}with{" "}
          <code>enroll</code>{" "}and <code>unenroll</code>{" "}functions,
          then wire the Dashboard and the People table to that store.
        </p>
        <p>
          Courses the user is enrolled in should provide a red Unenroll
          button, and courses the user is not enrolled in should provide
          a green Enroll button. When a user clicks Unenroll or Enroll,
          the enrollment status must actually change and the buttons
          should toggle to reflect the new state. If a user signs out
          and then signs in again, the enrollment choices should still
          persist for this session. If a user refreshes or reloads the
          page, the new enrollments are lost — that is expected until a
          later chapter persists them on a server. Protect the route to
          a course so that only users enrolled in that course can
          navigate to it, and stay on the Dashboard screen otherwise.

          covers every screen in <SectionLink to="4.10" />. The labs
          taught events, controlled fields, Context, and Zustand one
          idea at a time; these items are those ideas applied to the
          application you keep building. Each item points back to the
          section where you wired the worked example. Build in order as
          you read — this list is for checking coverage, not a
