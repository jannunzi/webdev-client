      <p>
        The current Kambaz implementation renders various courses,
        modules, and assignments using JSON files. The files were
        wrapped into a Database data structure that first lived in the
        React application and then in the Node server. It is time for
        the data to live where it belongs. This section demonstrates
        migrating the courses and modules into corresponding
        collections in the <code>kambaz</code>{" "}MongoDB database.
        Create the{" "}
        <OfficialLink href="https://mongoosejs.com/">
          Mongoose
        </OfficialLink>{" "}
        schemas, models, and DAOs, and refactor the RESTful Web APIs
        to CRUD courses and modules in the database. The URLs stay the
        same as in <ChapterLink to={5} />; only the source of the
        documents changes. Confirm that all courses and modules CRUD
        functionality works as expected. Optionally also migrate the
        assignments into a collection and confirm that all assignment
        CRUD operations work. The signed-in user still lives in
        Account Context; course lists still live in Zustand. Neither
        client store replaces the database — they cache what the
        routes return.

        <p>
          The current server application implements RESTful Web APIs
          to access courses stored in the <code>courses.js</code>{" "}
          file. This section replaces the source of the courses with a
          MongoDB <code>courses</code>{" "}collection. The basic
          operations on any data source are create, read, update, and
          delete, colloquially referred to as CRUD operations. The
          following sections demonstrate how to implement those CRUD
          operations for courses, one verb at a time, so you can
          confirm each change in Compass before you move on.

            To access the <code>courses</code>{" "}collection created
            earlier, create a Mongoose schema file as shown below. The
            schema file describes the constraints of the documents
            stored in a collection, such as the names of the
            properties, their data types, and the name of the
            collection where the documents will be stored.{" "}
            <code>_id</code>{" "}stays a string for the same reason the
            user schema did: enrollments and modules already store
            those identifiers as strings. <code>name</code>,{" "}
            <code>number</code>, and <code>description</code>{" "}are
            strings; <code>credits</code>{" "}is a number so you can
            sort or filter numerically later if you wish.

          <p>
            Using the Mongoose schema file, create a Mongoose model
            file as shown below. Mongoose models provide functions to
            interact with the collection such as <code>find()</code>,{" "}
            <code>create()</code>, <code>updateOne()</code>, and{" "}
            <code>deleteOne()</code>. The{" "}
            <code>CourseModel</code>{" "}name in the Mongoose model
            declares a unique name that can be used as a reference
            from other Mongoose schemas — enrollments will{" "}

            Using the Mongoose model, refactor the courses DAO file

            <code>findCoursesForEnrolledUser</code>{" "}functions to
            retrieve courses from the database instead of the
            Database file as shown below. The{" "}

            containing all the course documents in the{" "}
            <code>courses</code>{" "}collection. We will deal with
            moving enrollments to the database later in the chapter;
            for now the enrolled-user helper can still filter the
            full course list against the in-memory enrollments array
            if Mongo is not yet connected.

            The functions in Mongoose models all return promises,

      >
        <p>
          In Kambaz, each course contains several modules,
          establishing a <strong>one-to-many</strong>{" "}relationship.
          Currently the relationship is implemented by each module
          having a field that refers to the course they belong to.
          This section demonstrates how to use Mongoose to implement
          one-to-many relationships. In UML, one-to-many
          relationships can be illustrated as a course box connected
          to a modules box with a &quot;1&quot; on the course end and
          a &quot;*&quot; on the modules end. The{" "}
          <code>courses</code>{" "}collection is said to be on the one
          side of a one-to-many relation and the{" "}
          <code>modules</code>{" "}collection is said to be on the many
          side. The relationship describes that each course is
          related to many modules. It is often useful to think of the
          relationship as a parent-child relationship describing it
          as courses are the parents of many modules. Another way to
          think of the relationship is as an ownership relationship,
          as in courses have many modules.
        </p>
        <p>
          The easiest way to implement one-to-many relationships in
          both relational and non-relational databases is to use
          foreign keys referencing related records. Each module
          document contains a field <code>course</code>{" "}(or{" "}
          <code>courseId</code>) whose value is the{" "}
          <code>_id</code>{" "}of some course document the module
          belongs to. That is what Chapter 5 already did in JSON, and
          it is the shape this book&apos;s{" "}
          <code>modules</code>{" "}collection keeps so the existing{" "}
          <code>/api/courses/:courseId/modules</code>{" "}routes stay
          stable.
        </p>
        <p>
          In non-relational databases there are two additional
          alternatives to implement one-to-many relationships. One
          way is to include an array of foreign keys in the parent
          document that reference all the child documents. Documents
          in the <code>courses</code>{" "}collection would contain a{" "}
          <code>moduleIds</code>{" "}array that contains the values of
          primary keys of child module documents. The keys in that
          array can be used to retrieve the actual documents from the{" "}
          <code>modules</code>{" "}collection. Another alternative is
          to do away entirely with the collection on the many side
          and embed the documents in the collection on the one side.
          The <code>modules</code>{" "}collection would be removed and
          the documents would instead be embedded in the
          corresponding parent course document in a{" "}
          <code>modules</code>{" "}array. Because modules are not
          expected to be fetched outside a course, the original
          chapter embeds them on the course schema. This book also
          keeps a <code>modules</code>{" "}collection with a{" "}
          <code>course</code>{" "}field. Both shapes are valid; pick
          one per project and stick to it. The subsections below show
          the embed schema so you can read the original design, then
          implement the collection-plus-foreign-key DAO that matches
          the LiveDemo routes.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A foreign key on the child: each module has{" "}
            <code>course</code>{" "}equal to the course{" "}
            <code>_id</code>{" "}(what Chapter 5 already did in JSON,
            and what this book&apos;s collection uses).
          </li>
          <li>
            An array of child ids on the parent.
          </li>
          <li>
            Embed the child documents in the parent — a{" "}
            <code>modules</code>{" "}array on the course. No separate
            collection.

            Since modules are not expected to be accessible outside
            their course, the original design embeds the module
            documents in a new <code>modules</code>{" "}property in the
            course schema. To demonstrate, create the schema file
            below that describes the data structure of module
            documents. The embed version does not need a{" "}
            <code>course</code>{" "}field because the parent document
            already is the course.

            Note that lessons also have a one-to-many relationship
            with the modules they belong to. Although we could create
            a dedicated lessons schema file and then add it to the
            modules schema, we can alternatively declare the lessons
            schema inline within the modules schema as shown below.
            Creating a separate dedicated lesson schema would, in
            general, be a better practice, but since it is a trivial
            schema we can get away with declaring the lesson schema
            right inside the parent module schema.

            The new embed schema is not compatible with the courses
            you imported earlier with Compass, because those course
            documents do not contain a nested{" "}
            <code>modules</code>{" "}array. If you adopt embed, delete
            all the documents from the courses collection and import
            a new version that embeds the lessons into their modules
            and the modules into their courses. The{" "}
            <code>findAllCourses</code>{" "}and{" "}
            <code>findCoursesForEnrolledUser</code>{" "}functions in
            the courses DAO are only used in the Dashboard page,
            which only really needs the course&apos;s name and
            description. It would be unnecessarily expensive to
            include the modules and lessons from the server if they
            are not needed in the user interface. Refactor those
            functions so that they only include the{" "}

            properties in the response, using a projection as shown
            below. In the Dashboard, take a look at the response from
            the server and confirm that the courses only contain
            those two properties.

      >
        <p>
          In Kambaz, a user can be enrolled in several courses, and a
          course can have many enrollments. An enrollment establishes
          a relationship between a user and a course. Since there can
          be many enrollments where many users can be enrolled, or
          associated, in many courses, the enrollments relation is
          referred to as a <strong>many-to-many</strong>{" "}relation.
          Many-to-many relationships can be represented in UML as a
          users box connected to a courses box with asterisks on both
          ends, capturing the fact that many users are related to
          many courses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Implementing that diagram directly is awkward in both
          relational and document databases, because it implies that
          each record in the users collection contains several
          references to records in the courses collection and vice
          versa. Keeping those two arrays in sync is error-prone: if
          you enroll a user by pushing a course id onto the user, you
          must also push the user id onto the course, and a failed
          second write leaves the relationship half-applied. It is
          often easier to understand the implementation by using an
          intermediate collection that captures the relationship
          between each record in the original collections. A new{" "}
          <code>enrollments</code>{" "}collection refactors the
          many-to-many relationship as two one-to-many relationships.
          The new collection is often referred to as a mapping table
          or mapping collection. The original collections{" "}
          <code>users</code>{" "}and <code>courses</code>{" "}no longer
          need to know anything about each other. Instead a record
          entry in the enrollments collection captures what users are
          enrolled in what courses by declaring fields{" "}
          <code>user</code>{" "}and <code>course</code>{" "}that record
          references to the documents that are related to each other.
          The following sections describe how to implement
          many-to-many relationships using Mongoose.

            The Courses model implemented earlier declares{" "}
            <code>CourseModel</code>{" "}as the name of the model for
            course documents stored in the{" "}
            <code>courses</code>{" "}collection. This name can be used
            to establish relationships between models and
            collections. Similarly the Users model declares the name
            of the model as <code>UserModel</code>{" "}for user
            documents stored in the <code>users</code>{" "}collection.
            In a new schema file shown below, implement a many-to-many

          <p>
            Enrollments establish a many-to-many relationship between
            users and courses. A common operation consists of finding
            which documents in one collection are related to
            documents in the other collection. For instance, given a
            particular user we would like to determine which courses
            are related to that user — which courses is a user
            enrolled in. The <code>findCoursesForUser()</code>{" "}
            function below retrieves the enrollment documents for a
            given user. Those enrollment documents contain the
            primary keys for the user and course documents being
            referenced. The <code>populate()</code>{" "}function tells
            Mongoose to use the value of the primary keys to fetch
            the actual document referenced by the key.{" "}
            <code>populate(&quot;course&quot;)</code>{" "}replaces the
            course primary key value in the enrollment document with
            the actual course document from the{" "}
            <code>courses</code>{" "}collection corresponding to the
            key&apos;s value. The{" "}
            <code>enrollments.map()</code>{" "}operation unwraps the
            enrollments array and returns a new array with just the
            course objects, which is the shape Dashboard already
            expects.

            When a course goes away, every enrollment that pointed at
            it would otherwise become a dangling reference: Dashboard
            would try to populate a course id that no longer exists.

            In a prior assignment you implemented enrolling and
            unenrolling users from courses. The implementation relied
            on manipulating arrays of courses, users, and enrollments
            in a &quot;Database&quot; data structure. Now that we
            moved the data to an actual database, refactor your
            implementation to use enrollments stored in the database.
            The Enrollments DAO implements{" "}
            <code>enrollUserInCourse</code>{" "}and{" "}
            <code>unenrollUserFromCourse</code>{" "}functions as shown
            below. The <code>enrollUserInCourse</code>{" "}function
            inserts a new enrollment document in the enrollments
            collection creating a relation between a user and the
            course they are enrolled in. The{" "}
            <code>unenrollUserFromCourse</code>{" "}function deletes an
            existing enrollment document from the enrollments
            collection, removing the relation between a user and the
            course they were enrolled in.

            In the Courses routes implement post and delete routes
            that create or remove an enrollment using the
            corresponding DAO functions. If the path{" "}
            <code>uid</code>{" "}is <code>&quot;current&quot;</code>,
            read the session user the same way the enrolled-courses
            route does. If you had already implemented these
            functions in a prior assignment, feel free to use those
            functions instead or refactor at your own discretion.

            The Users screen implemented in an earlier section uses
            the People Table to display all the users in the database
            and allows admin users to create, read, update, and
            delete all users in the database. The People link in the
            Courses Navigation in the Courses page should display a
            page that lists all the users enrolled in the current
            course, not the whole <code>users</code>{" "}collection.
            Reimplement the People link so that the People Table only
            displays the users that are enrolled in a particular
            course when navigating to the People link. In the Courses

          Implement schema, model, DAO, routes, and client files so
          that the Assignments and Assignment Editor screens display
          assignments stored in a database. Users should be able to

          update assignments, and delete existing assignments. Confirm
          that all operations are reflected in the database. An
          assignment belongs to one course and a course has many
          assignments — the same one-to-many relationship you just

          is what this book does, or embed them on the course the way
          the original chapter embedded modules. Mirror the modules
