        Submit this chapter&apos;s work as a new branch on the same{" "}
        <code>kambaz-next-js</code>{" "}repository and deployment from earlier
        chapters, so graders can compare <ChapterLink to={2} />&apos;s styled
        prototype against this chapter&apos;s JavaScript and data-driven
        screens side by side.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Finish every exercise described in this chapter inside the same{" "}
          <code>kambaz-next-js</code>{" "}project used in <ChapterLink to={1} />{" "}
          and <ChapterLink to={2} />.

          Create a branch named <code>a3</code>, then add, commit, and push
          it to the same GitHub repository from <SectionLink to="1.5" />:
        </li>
      </ol>
      <CodeBlock language="shell">{`git checkout -b a3

          In Vercel, configure the project to deploy every branch to its own
          URL: open the project&apos;s <strong>Settings → Git</strong>{" "}and
          enable deployments for all branches (some Vercel plans expose this
          under <strong>Build & Deployment → Branches</strong>). From then on,
          each push to <code>a3</code>{" "}gets its own preview URL that
          contains the branch name, separate from your <ChapterLink to={2} />{" "}
          <code>a2</code>{" "}deployment.
        </li>
        <li>
          Confirm <code>app/labs/TOC.tsx</code>{" "}and{" "}
          <code>app/labs/page.tsx</code>{" "}still list every lab and Kambaz,
          plus a link to your GitHub repository with id{" "}
          <code>wd-github</code>{" "}and your full name (first name first,
          last name second, matching Canvas) on the Labs page — the same
          requirements from <SectionLink to="1.7" />, now revisited for this chapter.
        </li>
        <li>
          Push any remaining changes to the <code>a3</code>{" "}branch and
          confirm the branch deployment on Vercel reflects them.
        </li>
        <li>
          In Canvas, submit both the GitHub repository URL (pointed at the{" "}
          <code>a3</code>{" "}branch) and the Vercel deployment URL for that
          branch. Disable Vercel&apos;s Deployment Protection on that
          deployment, as in <SectionLink to="1.6" />, so graders can open it without signing in.
