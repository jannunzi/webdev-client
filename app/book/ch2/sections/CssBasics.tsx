        <p>
          Every HTML tag accepts a <code>style</code>{" "}attribute — the same
          name/value pattern introduced with <code>id</code>{" "}in{" "}
          <SectionLink to="1.3.1" />{" "}— that configures the look and feel of
          that one tag directly. In JSX the
          value is not a plain string like in HTML — it is a JavaScript
          object literal (hence the double curly braces: one pair to enter a
          JSX expression, one pair for the object itself), and property names
          are camelCase instead of hyphenated, so{" "}
          <code>background-color</code>{" "}becomes <code>backgroundColor</code>.

          Add a styled paragraph to <code>app/labs/lab2/page.tsx</code>{" "}
          warning readers about the very technique it demonstrates — the
          style attribute is convenient for a quick experiment, but scattering
          styles across individual tags makes a real project hard to
          maintain, which is why the rest of this section moves styling into
          separate CSS files instead:

      >
        <p>
          The recommended alternative to inline styles is a dedicated{" "}
          <strong>CSS file</strong>: a plain text document you import into a
          component, the same way you import a React component or a library.
          Create <code>app/labs/lab2/index.css</code>{" "}alongside{" "}
          <code>page.tsx</code>{" "}with this content:
        </p>
        <CodeBlock
          language="css"
          name="Lab2 styles"
          file="app/labs/lab2/index.css"
        >{`p {
  background-color: green;
  color: white;
}`}</CodeBlock>
        <p>
          The code snippet above is referred to as a CSS <strong>rule</strong> which consists of the following parts:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The <strong>selector</strong>{" "}is everything before the opening
            curly brace — here, the tag name <code>p</code>. The selector is used to refer to the HTML elements that will be styled.
          </li>
          <li>
            The curly braces wrap a <strong>declaration block</strong> which contains the
            list of styles to apply to the selected elements.
          </li>
          <li>
            Each line inside the block is a <strong>declaration</strong> which consists of a{" "}
            <strong>property</strong>{" "}(what to change), a colon, a{" "}
            <strong>value</strong>{" "}(what to change it to), and a semicolon.
            So <code>background-color</code>{" "}is the property and{" "}
            <code>green</code>{" "}is the value.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In a CSS file, property names use hyphens —{" "}
          <code>background-color</code>{" "}— that is the original CSS syntax.
          The JSX <code>style</code>{" "}object in <SectionLink to="2.1.1" />{" "}
          is not a CSS document. It is a JavaScript object, so an
          unquoted key must be a valid identifier. Hyphens are not allowed in
          identifiers, which is why that object used camelCase:{" "}
          <code>backgroundColor</code>. You can keep the hyphenated CSS name
          in JavaScript if you quote the key, as in{" "}
          <code>{`{ "background-color": "green" }`}</code>. Unquoted camelCase
          is the usual convention in React.
        </p>
        <p>
          A rule, then, is a selector plus its declaration block. Later
          sections introduce new kinds of selectors and many more properties;
          they still assemble into this same shape.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remove the <code>style</code>{" "}attribute from the paragraph and
          import <code>index.css</code>{" "}at the top of{" "}
          <code>page.tsx</code>{" "}instead:
        </p>
        <CodeBlock

          By the time a browser paints an element, several rules may compete
          to set the same property — a browser default, a tag selector, a
          class, an id. The &quot;<strong>Cascading</strong>&quot;{" "}in
          Cascading Style Sheets describes exactly how the browser picks a
          winner:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Specificity</strong>: more precise selectors win over
            more general ones. An id selector beats a class selector, which
            beats a plain tag selector, which beats the browser&apos;s
            built-in default.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Source order</strong>: if two rules have the same
            specificity, the rule declared later in the CSS wins — this is
            why the ID selectors in <SectionLink to="2.1.3" />{" "}had to come after (or replace) the
            tag selector from <SectionLink to="2.1.2" />, not merely exist alongside it with
            lower specificity resolving the conflict on their own.

          <li>
            <strong>Inheritance</strong>: some properties, like{" "}
            <code>color</code>{" "}and other font properties, pass down from a
            parent element to its children automatically unless overridden.
            Layout properties like <code>width</code>{" "}and{" "}
            <code>margin</code>{" "}do not inherit — each element needs its own
            rule.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Keep this order in mind whenever a style you expect to see does not
          appear: check first whether a more specific selector elsewhere is
          winning, then whether a later rule with equal specificity is
          overriding it.

          In <code>index.css</code>, deliberately
          conflict a tag rule, a class rule, and an id rule on the same property for
          one element in <code>page.tsx</code>, then use DevTools to confirm
          specificity (and source order) pick the winner you expect.

Add a sample paragraph with id wd-ai-cascade and class wd-ai-cascade that also matches a p tag rule, all three setting background-color to different colors (tag green, class yellow, id red). Put the id rule last. Add a short comment above the rules naming which selector should win.`}
