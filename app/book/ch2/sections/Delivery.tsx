        Submit this chapter&apos;s work as a new branch on the same{" "}
        <code>web-dev-client</code>{" "}repository and deployment from Chapter
        1, so graders can compare <ChapterLink to={1} />&apos;s HTML-only prototype against
        this chapter&apos;s CSS, Tailwind, and Tailwind version side by
        side.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Finish every exercise described in this chapter inside the same{" "}

        </li>

          Create a branch named <code>a2</code>, then add, commit, and push
          it to the same GitHub repository from <SectionLink to="1.5" />:

          In Vercel, configure the project to deploy every branch to its own
          URL: open the project&apos;s <strong>Settings → Git</strong>{" "}and
          enable deployments for all branches (some Vercel plans expose this
          under <strong>Build & Deployment → Branches</strong>). From then on,
          each push to <code>a2</code>{" "}gets its own preview URL that
          contains the branch name, separate from your <ChapterLink to={1} />{" "}
          <code>main</code>{" "}deployment.

          Confirm <code>app/labs/TOC.tsx</code>{" "}and{" "}

          plus a link to your GitHub repository with id{" "}
          <code>wd-github</code>{" "}and your full name (first name first,
          last name second, matching Canvas) on the Labs page — the same
          requirements from <SectionLink to="1.7" />, now revisited for this chapter.
        </li>
        <li>
          Push any remaining changes to the <code>a2</code>{" "}branch and
          confirm the branch deployment on Vercel reflects them.
        </li>
        <li>
          In Canvas, submit both the GitHub repository URL (pointed at the{" "}
          <code>a2</code>{" "}branch) and the Vercel deployment URL for that
          branch. Disable Vercel&apos;s Deployment Protection on that
          deployment, as in <SectionLink to="1.6" />, so graders can open it without signing in.
