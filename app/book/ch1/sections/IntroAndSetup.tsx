          , a robust, decentralized, and redundant communication infrastructure
          capable of maintaining connectivity even in the event of major
          disruptions. By the 1980s, the standardization of protocols like{" "}

          during his tenure at{" "}
          <OfficialLink href="https://home.cern/">
            <strong>CERN</strong>
          </OfficialLink>
          , the European particle physics laboratory in Switzerland. The
          objective was to enable the efficient sharing and linking of research
          documents over the existing Internet. In March 1989, Sir Tim
          Berners-Lee proposed a system of hypertext documents connected via
          hyperlinks, which users access through Uniform Resource Locators (
          <OfficialLink href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/">
            <strong>URL</strong>
          </OfficialLink>

            <strong>HTTP</strong>
          </OfficialLink>
          ). By 1990, he had created the first web browser (named{" "}

            <strong>WorldWideWeb</strong>

          ), a <strong>web server</strong>, and the foundational HyperText Markup

          <OfficialLink href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/">
            <strong>HTML</strong>
          </OfficialLink>
          ) language to create HTTP <strong>web pages</strong>. Browsers and
          servers connect to one another over the internet in a client-server
          architecture (
          <FigureLink to="1.1" />
          ). Sir Tim Berners-Lee made the Web public in 1991, and on April 30,
          1993, CERN released the technology into the public domain, facilitating
          explosive growth. Presently, billions of static and dynamic pages power
          various systems ranging from simple sites to complex applications.

          Web pages are comprised of plain text documents formatted with{" "}
          <strong>HTML</strong>, a dialect of{" "}
          <OfficialLink href="https://www.w3.org/XML/">
            <strong>XML</strong>
          </OfficialLink>{" "}
          (
          <strong>eXtensible Markup Language</strong>). HTML is a computer
          language utilized to format the content displayed in web pages,
          including properties such as foreground and background color, white
          spaces, text alignment, font, lists, tables, and forms. Browsers
          establish a network connection with servers to send HTTP Requests for
          HTML documents. These requests rely on Uniform Resource Locators (
          <strong>URL</strong>s). A URL such as{" "}
          <code>http://www.nasa.gov</code>{" "}names the{" "}
          <strong>protocol</strong>{" "}(
          <code>http</code> — Hypertext Transfer Protocol), then the{" "}
          <strong>server</strong>{" "}(
          <code>www.nasa.gov</code>). That hostname is mapped to an IP
          address so the browser can find the machine on the network. A{" "}
          <strong>path</strong>{" "}after the server name pinpoints a specific
          document. Local development uses the same pattern:{" "}
          <LocalUrl href="/labs/lab1" /> — here{" "}
          <code>http</code>{" "}is still the protocol,{" "}
          <code>localhost</code>{" "}is the hostname for your own machine,{" "}
          <code>3000</code>{" "}is the <strong>port</strong>{" "}where the Next.js
          dev server listens, and{" "}
          <code>/labs/lab1</code>{" "}is the path to Lab 1. Servers
          locate the requested documents, and then respond with the
          document&apos;s content. Browsers parse HTML documents to create
          in-memory object representations known as the{" "}
          <OfficialLink href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/">
            <strong>DOM</strong>
          </OfficialLink>{" "}
          (
          <strong>Document Object Model</strong>). The DOM consists of a
          hierarchical data structure where each node is configured to render
          content in a specific format and style. This chapter examines using
          HTML for formatting web pages and creating user interfaces.
        </p>
        <p>
          Plain HTML documents are static: the same document does not change
          over time, and does not depend on the data or user interactions.
          The Web quickly reached the limit of what could be render on a screen.
           — a list of courses that never changes, a heading that
          never knows who signed in. In the early 1990s, servers began to{" "}
          <em>compute</em>{" "}HTML on request so the content could be data
          driven and interact with users. Scripts on the server —{" "}
          <OfficialLink href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3875">
            CGI
          </OfficialLink>
          , then languages such as{" "}
          <OfficialLink href="https://www.php.net/">
            <strong>PHP</strong>
          </OfficialLink>{" "}
          — could assemble a finished document and send it to the browser. Every
          click still meant a full round trip for a new page.{" "}
          <OfficialLink href="https://tc39.es/ecma262/">
            <strong>JavaScript</strong>

          in 1995, brought that computation into the browser. HTML documents
          download <code>.js</code>{" "}files from the server; the browser
          runs them to manipulate the DOM and build dynamic user interfaces
          without a full round trip for every change. The same language now
          also runs on the server — in{" "}
          <FigureLink to="1.1" />, the client box is HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
          and React; the Node.js box is JavaScript too. This course uses
          both: later chapters generate HTML on the server and still use
          the browser for clicks, state, and anything that reads the
          address bar.{" "}

          is a popular JavaScript library developed by
          Meta for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces. It promotes
          a component-based architecture where developers break down complex UIs
          into small and reusable pieces of code called{" "}
          <strong>components</strong>. React efficiently manages the state of
          these components, ensuring that the user interface stays in sync with
          underlying data changes and user interaction. Developers use React to
          build Single Page
          Applications (
          <OfficialLink href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application">
            <strong>SPA</strong>
          </OfficialLink>
          s), which provide a seamless, fluid
          user experience by updating only the necessary parts of the page
          without requiring full-page reloads — unlike traditional multi-page
          sites, where every link often fetches an entirely new HTML document
          from the server. Its declarative nature simplifies
          the process of creating complex web interfaces by describing what the
          UI should look like for a given state.

            <strong>Next.js</strong>
          </OfficialLink>{" "}
          is a powerful framework designed to simplify
          the construction of full-stack web applications. Built on top of React,
          it provides an all-in-one solution that includes robust features such
          as server-side rendering (
          <OfficialLink href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-side_rendering">
            <strong>SSR</strong>
          </OfficialLink>
          ), static site generation (
          <OfficialLink href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator">
            <strong>SSG</strong>
          </OfficialLink>
          ), and seamless API endpoint integration. Next.js
          extends React by offering built-in routing, data fetching, and
          performance optimizations, allowing developers to create highly
          scalable applications that interact efficiently with backend resources,
          such as MongoDB, over HTTP.

          This chapter describes how to install and configure a local development
          environment for building Next.js applications. Development is done in
          the local environment and then shared in a remote{" "}
          <OfficialLink href="https://github.com/">
            GitHub
          </OfficialLink>{" "}
          source repository. The source in GitHub is then deployed to a remote
          server hosted on{" "}
          <OfficialLink href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</OfficialLink>{" "}
          which is optimized for Next.js and provides seamless
          serverless deployment. This chapter introduces creating a Next.js
          application and explores building user interfaces using HTML and
          JavaScript. Various HTML elements are described to render user
          interface content, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, and
          form elements. All sections in this chapter contain exercises that
          introduce basic HTML elements and concepts, giving an opportunity to
          learn and practice HTML skills. The exercises provide detailed
          instructions to successfully accomplish the tasks. Make sure to
          complete all exercises described in the book.

          The <strong>Kambaz</strong>{" "}sections in each chapter contain exercises
          that ask readers to build a fully functional web application inspired
          by a popular Learning Management System (
          <OfficialLink href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_management_system">
            <strong>LMS</strong>
          </OfficialLink>
          ) with a
          similar name. The exercises provide sample code and requirements but
          deliberately leave out steps where the reader is expected to experiment
          and discover how to implement the requirements using the skills learned
          in prior sections. This chapter focuses on using plain HTML within
          Next.js components to implement a draft, rough prototype of various
          Kambaz screens, which at first won&apos;t look like the target
          product in <FigureLink to="1a" />–<FigureLink to="1d">1d</FigureLink>.
          Later chapters will continue working on the Kambaz
          application, introducing Cascading Style Sheets (
          <OfficialLink href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/">
            <strong>CSS</strong>
          </OfficialLink>

          to style the Web pages so they look more like these screen shots,
          and integrating MongoDB for data persistence.

          is a JavaScript runtime that lets you run

          the local development server, installs and manages project
          dependencies, and later enables server-side features such as API
          routes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Installing Node.js also gives you two companion tools,{" "}

          1.2.4 Creating a Next.js Application
        </h3>
        <p>
          With <code>npx</code> — the tool that shipped with your Node.js
          install — you can scaffold a new Next.js project from a maintained
          template that already follows current best practices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Start by creating a place on disk for your coursework. From your home
          directory (<code>~</code>), make a folder for the year, the term, and
          the course. On macOS use Terminal; on Windows use Command Prompt or
          PowerShell. For example, to create{" "}
          <code>~/2049/winter/webdev</code>:
        </p>
        <CodeBlock language="shell">{`cd ~
mkdir 2049
mkdir 2049/winter
mkdir 2049/winter/webdev
cd 2049/winter/webdev`}</CodeBlock>
        <p>
          You can pick another location if you prefer. Keep names lowercase,
          avoid spaces, and nest the project only under directories that follow
          the same rules — that prevents a lot of path and tooling headaches
          later.
        </p>
        <p>
          From that folder (or from the IDE&apos;s integrated terminal), create
          the app with:
        </p>
        <CodeBlock language="shell">{`npx create-next-app@latest`}</CodeBlock>
        <p>
          The first time you run this, npm may ask permission to download the{" "}
          <code>create-next-app</code>{" "}package. Accept and continue:
        </p>
        <CodeBlock language="shell">{`Need to install the following packages:

        <p>
          When prompted for a project name, enter{" "}
          <code>webdev-client</code>. For the remaining prompts — TypeScript,
          ESLint,{" "}
          <OfficialLink href="https://tailwindcss.com/">
            Tailwind CSS

            Turbopack
          </OfficialLink>
          , and the <code>@/*</code>{" "}import alias — choose the defaults
          (typically Yes for TypeScript, ESLint, Tailwind, App Router, and
          Turbopack; No for a <code>src/</code>{" "}directory and for customizing
          the alias). Exact wording can vary slightly by{" "}
          <code>create-next-app</code>{" "}version.
        </p>
        <CodeBlock language="shell">{`✔ What is your project named? … webdev-client

✔ Would you like to customize the import alias (\`@/*\` by default)? … No / Yes`}</CodeBlock>
        <p>
          Wait while dependencies install (<code>react</code>,{" "}
          <code>react-dom</code>, <code>next</code>, TypeScript types, Tailwind,
          ESLint, and related packages). When it finishes you should see a
          success message and a new <code>webdev-client</code>{" "}directory. Change
          into that directory and start the development server:
        </p>
        <CodeBlock language="shell">{`cd webdev-client
npm run dev`}</CodeBlock>
        <p>
          The console should report that Next.js is ready and print a local URL,
          usually{" "}
          <LocalUrl href="/" />
          . Open that URL in{" "}
          <OfficialLink href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">
            <strong>Google Chrome</strong>
          </OfficialLink>{" "}
          and confirm the
          default Next.js starter page (logo and getting-started content)
          appears. Stop the server anytime with <strong>Ctrl+C</strong>.

        <p>
          You can start the app from any terminal, but prefer running{" "}

          1.2.5 Creating Pages and Routes with the App Router
        </h3>
        <p>
          Next.js user interfaces are written as JavaScript functions (or
          classes) called <strong>components</strong>. A component{" "}
          <em>computes</em>{" "}HTML: it can choose markup, text, or structure
          from data instead of returning the same static document every time.
          To make that easier to write, the syntax blurs the line between
          JavaScript and HTML — you put HTML-like markup right in the function.
          That mix is called{" "}
          <OfficialLink href="https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx">
            <strong>JSX</strong>
          </OfficialLink>{" "}
          (JavaScript XML). Files that use JSX typically end in{" "}
          <code>.jsx</code>. Chapter 3 covers JavaScript in more depth; for now,
          focus on the HTML-like markup inside each component.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>TypeScript</strong>{" "}is a superset of JavaScript that adds
          static typing. It has become the preferred language for many React and
          Next.js projects because types catch mistakes early, make larger
          codebases easier to refactor, and improve editor tooling (autocomplete,
          jump-to-definition, and clearer errors). Next.js supports TypeScript
          out of the box, and it is what this course uses. Component files
          therefore end in <code>.tsx</code>. When people say &quot;JSX&quot; in
          conversation, they often mean the markup syntax itself, whether the
          file is <code>.jsx</code>{" "}or <code>.tsx</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before you create Lab 1, it helps to know how the browser address bar
          connects to files on disk. A <strong>URL path</strong>{" "}(for example{" "}
          <code>/labs/lab1</code>) is what the user opens. In Next.js we call
          that a <strong>route</strong>: a destination your app knows how to
          render. You do not register routes in a central config file for the
          basics of this course. Instead, the shape of folders under{" "}
          <code>app/</code>{" "}defines the routes.
        </p>
        <p>
          That folder-based system is the{" "}
          <OfficialLink href="https://nextjs.org/docs/app">
            <strong>App Router</strong>
          </OfficialLink>{" "}
          — Next.js
          &apos;s current routing model (you chose it when you answered
          &quot;Would you like to use App Router?&quot; during{" "}
          <code>create-next-app</code>). An older Next.js style put routes under
          a <code>pages/</code>{" "}directory (the Pages Router). This course uses
          the App Router exclusively: look for an <code>app/</code>{" "}folder, not{" "}
          <code>pages/</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inside <code>app/</code>, the filename{" "}
          <code>page.tsx</code>{" "}is reserved. When a folder contains{" "}
          <code>page.tsx</code>, Next.js exposes that folder as a public route.
          Nested folders become nested path segments:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>app/page.tsx</code>{" "}→ <code>/</code>{" "}(the site root)
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>app/labs/page.tsx</code>{" "}→ <code>/labs</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>app/labs/lab1/page.tsx</code>{" "}→ <code>/labs/lab1</code>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In the IDE Explorer, open the <code>app</code>{" "}directory and create
          Lab 1 at <code>app/labs/lab1/page.tsx</code>{" "}with the following
          source:
        </p>
        <CodeBlock language="tsx" name="Lab1" file="app/labs/lab1/page.tsx">{`export default function Lab1() {
  return (
    <div id="wd-lab1">
      <h2>Lab 1</h2>
    </div>
  );
}`}</CodeBlock>
        <p>
          <code>Lab1</code>{" "}is a default-exported React component. Because the
          file is named <code>page.tsx</code>{" "}under{" "}
          <code>app/labs/lab1/</code>, the App Router registers the route{" "}
          <code>/labs/lab1</code>. The function returns a <code>div</code>{" "}
          (division element) that contains an <code>h2</code>{" "}heading with the
          text &quot;Lab 1&quot;. Save the file, keep{" "}
          <code>npm run dev</code>{" "}running, and open{" "}
          <LocalUrl href="/labs/lab1" />{" "}in the browser to
          confirm it renders.
        </p>
        <LiveDemo name="Lab1" file="app/labs/lab1/page.tsx">
          <Lab1Starter />
        </LiveDemo>
        <p>
          As you add HTML examples in the next sections, keep{" "}
          <code>page.tsx</code>{" "}as a thin page that imports smaller components
          (one file per exercise) instead of pasting everything into this one
          file. Those exercise files — for example{" "}
          <code>HeadingTags.tsx</code>{" "}later in Lab 1 — are components, not
          new routes. Only <code>page.tsx</code>{" "}creates a URL; other{" "}
          <code>.tsx</code>{" "}files are imported into the page when you need
          them. Lab 1 stays a single URL while its content grows.
        </p>
        <p>
          The starter project also loads Tailwind CSS through{" "}
          <code>app/globals.css</code>. For the HTML exercises in this chapter we
          want the browser&apos;s default styling, so comment out that import in{" "}
          <code>app/layout.tsx</code>{" "}and leave the rest of the file alone:
        </p>
        <CodeBlock language="tsx" name="RootLayout" file="app/layout.tsx">{`import type { Metadata } from "next";
import { Geist, Geist_Mono } from "next/font/google";
// import "./globals.css";
// ... leave the rest of this file alone`}</CodeBlock>
        <p>
          Later chapters return to CSS and Tailwind when we start styling Kambaz
          and the labs more deliberately.
