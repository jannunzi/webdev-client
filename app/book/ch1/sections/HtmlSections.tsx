      <Section id="sec-1-3" title="1.3 Introduction to HTML">
        <p>
          <strong>HTML</strong>{" "}(HyperText Markup Language) is a specialized
          dialect of <strong>XML</strong>{" "}(eXtensible Markup Language) designed
          for structuring and formatting plain text so web browsers can interpret
          and render it with specific styles, layouts, and interactivity. In
          Next.js you write that HTML as <strong>JSX</strong>{" "}inside React
          components (in <code>.tsx</code>{" "}files — see <SectionLink to="1.2.5" />). For this chapter,
          focus on the tags and structure; treat the surrounding component syntax
          as the container that delivers HTML to the browser. A coverage
          checklist is in <SectionLink to="1.3.12" /> — use it after you have
          walked through the tags, not instead of building them as you read.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider the following snippet, which marks the text &quot;Labs&quot;
          as a level-1 heading so the browser typically shows it large and bold:
        </p>
        <CodeBlock language="html">{`<h1>Labs</h1>`}</CodeBlock>
        <p>
          The browser shows &quot;Labs&quot; as a large, bold level-1 heading —
          the visual cue that this is a top-level title:
        </p>
        <LiveDemo>
          <h1>Labs</h1>
        </LiveDemo>
        <p>
          In that code, <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>{" "}and <code>&lt;/h1&gt;</code>{" "}are
          called <strong>tags</strong>. <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>{" "}is the{" "}
          <strong>opening tag</strong>, and <code>&lt;/h1&gt;</code>{" "}is the{" "}
          <strong>closing tag</strong>. The text &quot;Labs&quot; between them
          is the <strong>body</strong>{" "}(or content) of the tag. Tags add
          semantic meaning — for example, <code>h1</code>{" "}signals a top-level
          heading, which browsers style with a larger font and bold weight by
          default.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a browser parses this HTML (or JSX in a Next.js component), it
          builds an in-memory tree called the <strong>DOM</strong>{" "}(Document
          Object Model). Each tag becomes a <strong>node</strong>{" "}in that tree.
          The DOM is what the browser uses to paint the page, and JavaScript —
          including React in Next.js — can programmatically update nodes later without reloading
          the whole page.
        </p>
        <p>
          We often say &quot;tag&quot; and &quot;element&quot; interchangeably,
          but there is a small distinction. A <strong>tag</strong>{" "}is the
          textual syntax in your source (for example{" "}
          <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>), while an <strong>element</strong>{" "}is the
          fuller idea — the tag, optional <strong>attributes</strong>{" "}(settings
          on the opening tag — introduced with <code>id</code>{" "}in <SectionLink to="1.3.1" />), its
          body, and the DOM node that results. Either word is fine day to day;
          the distinction mainly helps when you inspect the page in tools like{" "}
          <strong>Chrome DevTools</strong>.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section
        level={3}
        id="sec-1-3-1"
        title="1.3.1 Structuring Web Content with the HTML Heading, Div, and Span Tags"
      >
        <p>
          The <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>{" "}through <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code>{" "}tags
          format section titles so they render larger and bolder than the plain
          text that follows. Text documents are often broken up into several
          sections and subsections, and each section is usually prefaced with a
          short title that summarizes the topic it precedes.{" "}
          <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>{" "}is the largest heading;{" "}
          <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code>{" "}is the smallest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another common element is the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>{" "}tag (division
          tag) — a generic container used to group elements together. Unlike
          headings, <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>{" "}does not add much inherent visual
          styling beyond behaving like a <strong>block</strong>. It starts on a
          new line and stretches as wide as its parent. Its job is grouping a
          heading, paragraph, and image as one unit so you can style or lay
          them out together later with CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
          The opposite of a block is an <strong>inline</strong>{" "}element. Inline
          tags sit in the line of text without breaking to a new row — the way
          a word sits among other words. The generic inline container is the{" "}
          <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>{" "}tag. Later you will meet other inline tags such as{" "}
          <code>a</code>{" "}(links in <SectionLink to="1.3.9" />) and many form
          controls. Headings, <code>p</code>, <code>div</code>, lists, and{" "}
          <code>form</code>{" "}are blocks; <code>span</code>, <code>a</code>, and{" "}
          <code>strong</code>{" "}are inline. <ChapterLink to={2} />{" "}lets you
          change that default with the CSS <code>display</code>{" "}property (
          <SectionLink to="2.1.12" />); for now, notice the difference in the
          heading example below — the{" "}
          <code>div</code>{" "}and <code>h4</code>{" "}each start on their own line,
          while the <code>span</code>{" "}stays in its sentence.
        </p>
        <p>
          For Lab 1, keep each HTML topic in its own component under{" "}
          <code>app/labs/lab1/</code>, then import those components into{" "}
          <code>app/labs/lab1/page.tsx</code>. Start with headings by creating{" "}
          <code>app/labs/lab1/HeadingTags.tsx</code>{" "}with a{" "}
          <code>div</code>{" "}that holds an <code>h4</code>{" "}plus the explanatory
          text about heading tags:
        </p>
        <CodeBlock
          language="tsx"
          name="HeadingTags"
          file="app/labs/lab1/HeadingTags.tsx"
        >{`export default function HeadingTags() {
  return (
    <div id="wd-h-tag">
      <h4>Heading Tags</h4>
      Text documents are often broken up into several sections and subsections.
      Each section is usually prefaced with a short title or heading that
      attempts to summarize the topic of the section it precedes. For instance
      this paragraph is preceded by the heading Heading Tags. The font of the
      section headings are usually larger and bolder than their subsection
      headings. This document uses headings to introduce topics such as HTML
      Documents, HTML Tags, Heading Tags, etc. HTML heading tags can be used
      to format plain text so that it renders in a browser as large headings.
      There are 6 heading tags for different sizes: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and
      h6. Tag h1 is the largest heading and h6 is the smallest heading. A{" "}
      <span id="wd-inline-span">span</span> sits in this sentence without
      starting a new line.
    </div>
  );
}`}</CodeBlock>
        <p>
          Notice <code>id=&quot;wd-h-tag&quot;</code>{" "}on the opening{" "}
          <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>. That is an <strong>attribute</strong> — a
          name/value pair written inside the opening tag that configures the
          element. Here the name is <code>id</code>{" "}and the value is{" "}
          <code>wd-h-tag</code>. An <code>id</code>{" "}gives the element a unique
          name on the page — useful for styling, testing, and (later) linking to
          a spot in the document. You will see many more attributes as you add
          images, forms, and links. The pattern is always{" "}
          <code>name=&quot;value&quot;</code>{" "}on the opening tag.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <code>h4</code>{" "}stands out above the body text, and the{" "}
          <code>div</code>{" "}keeps them grouped as one block — nothing flashy yet,
          just structure:

        </LiveDemo>
        <p>
          <strong>Try Chrome DevTools.</strong>{" "}With Lab 1 open in Chrome, press{" "}
          <code>F12</code>{" "}(or <code>Cmd+Option+I</code>{" "}on macOS /{" "}
          <code>Ctrl+Shift+I</code>{" "}on Windows) to open{" "}
          <strong>Developer Tools</strong>. Choose the{" "}
          <strong>Elements</strong>{" "}panel — that shows the live DOM tree the
          browser built from your JSX. Use Find (<code>Cmd+F</code>{" "}/{" "}
          <code>Ctrl+F</code>{" "}inside the panel) and search for{" "}
          <code>wd-h-tag</code>. You should land on the{" "}
          <code>&lt;div id=&quot;wd-h-tag&quot;&gt;</code>{" "}node. Click it and
          glance at the styles and attributes on the right. This habit — find an{" "}
          <code>id</code>, inspect the node — is how you debug markup for the
          rest of the course.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, wire the component into Lab 1. In{" "}
          <code>app/labs/lab1/page.tsx</code>, add an <code>h3</code>{" "}for
          &quot;HTML Examples&quot;, import <code>HeadingTags</code>, and render
          it. The <code>import</code>{" "}line brings the default export from{" "}
          <code>HeadingTags.tsx</code>{" "}into this file so you can use{" "}
          <code>&lt;HeadingTags /&gt;</code>{" "}like an HTML tag:

        <CodeBlock

          At <LocalUrl href="/labs/lab1">/labs/lab1</LocalUrl>{" "}you should see Lab 1, HTML Examples, and
          Heading Tags appear as successively smaller headings, and that the

        <p>
          The <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>{" "}tag wraps a block of text so the browser
          adds vertical space around it. Browsers ignore extra spaces, tabs, and
          newlines in your source, so without paragraph tags those blocks blend
          together. Create <code>app/labs/lab1/ParagraphTag.tsx</code>{" "}for this

        <p>
          Without paragraph tags around later blocks, the browser treats the
          text as one contiguous stream that flows left to right and wraps only
          when it runs out of horizontal space. That is{" "}
          <strong>inline</strong>{" "}layout behavior. Even if you put blank lines
          between paragraphs in the source, those breaks are ignored and the

      This is the first paragraph. The paragraph tag is used to format
      vertical gaps between long pieces of text like this one.

      This is the second paragraph. Even though there is a deliberate white
      gap between the paragraph above and this paragraph, by default browsers
      render them as one contiguous piece of text as shown here on the right.

      This is the third paragraph. Wrap each paragraph with the paragraph tag
      to tell browsers to render the gaps.
    </div>
  );

        <p>
          Those blank lines in the source disappear in the browser — the three

        <p>
          To get the intended vertical spacing, wrap each paragraph so the
          browser adds margin above and below. Paragraph and heading tags are{" "}
          <strong>block elements</strong>. They take the full width of their
          parent and add vertical space before and after their content. By
          combining inline and block layout, you can build clearer document
          structures.

          <strong>unordered</strong>. Ordered lists (<code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>)

          Unordered lists (<code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>) are for collections where

        <p>
          The numbered steps do not look like a list — they run together on one
          flowing line, the same way unwrapped paragraphs did:

          The intended formatting can be achieved by wrapping the whole list
          in <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> / <code>&lt;/ol&gt;</code>, and each step
          in <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> / <code>&lt;/li&gt;</code>. The browser
          numbers the items for you, so the sequence stays correct even if you
          add or remove steps. You might want to remove the unnecessary numbers added earlier.

      >
        <p>
          The <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>{" "}tag organizes data into rows and
          columns. HTML began as a way to share scientific documents among
          physicists, and those documents often included structured measurements
          — speed, temperature, location — presented in tabular form, which is
          why the tag was added in the mid-1990s. For example, quiz grades over a
          semester can look like this:
        </p>
        <div className="my-4 overflow-x-auto">
          <table className="w-full border-collapse border border-neutral-400 text-left text-sm">

        </div>
        <p>Several things to note:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>The first row is formatted as headings for each column.</li>
          <li>There are data rows — one quiz per row.</li>
          <li>Data under the same column shares the same kind of value, e.g. name, date, grade, etc.</li>
          <li>The last row is formatted as a footer.</li>
          <li>
            The first three columns of the footer are merged into one cell
            (cells can span to adjacent rows or columns).
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>HTML tables use nested tags:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>table</code> — declares the table
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>thead</code> — heading section
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>tbody</code> — main data rows
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>tfoot</code> — footer section
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>tr</code> — a row
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>th</code> — a heading cell
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>td</code> — a data cell
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Those tags define structure. Presentational attributes on the table
          and its cells control size, borders, merging, and alignment — useful
          now, before CSS in <ChapterLink to="2" />. In JSX some names are
          camelCase because they map to DOM properties:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>border</code> — on <code>table</code>. Pixel thickness of the
            grid. Use <code>0</code> for none, <code>1</code> for a thin line (
            <code>border={"{1}"}</code>). Larger integers draw thicker lines.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>width</code> — on <code>table</code>, <code>td</code>, or{" "}
            <code>th</code>. Size as a percentage of the parent (
            <code>&quot;100%&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;25%&quot;</code>) or in
            pixels (<code>&quot;200&quot;</code>).{" "}
            <code>width=&quot;100%&quot;</code> stretches the table across its
            container.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>colSpan</code> — on <code>td</code> or <code>th</code> (HTML{" "}
            <code>colspan</code>). How many columns this cell occupies. A
            positive integer; default is <code>1</code>. The Average row uses{" "}
            <code>colSpan={"{3}"}</code> so the label covers Quiz, Topic, and
            Date.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>rowSpan</code> — on <code>td</code> or <code>th</code> (HTML{" "}
            <code>rowspan</code>). How many rows this cell occupies. A positive
            integer; default is <code>1</code>. Use it when one label should sit
            beside several rows — for example a unit that covers Q1–Q3.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>align</code> — on <code>td</code>, <code>th</code>, or{" "}
            <code>tr</code>. Horizontal placement of the cell&apos;s content:{" "}
            <code>&quot;left&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;center&quot;</code>,{" "}
            <code>&quot;right&quot;</code> (also{" "}
            <code>&quot;justify&quot;</code>). Default for data cells is left;
            heading cells often default to center. Numbers read more clearly
            when right-aligned; short labels and dates often sit in the center.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>valign</code> — on <code>td</code>, <code>th</code>, or{" "}
            <code>tr</code>. Vertical placement when a row is taller than its
            content: <code>&quot;top&quot;</code>,{" "}
            <code>&quot;middle&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;bottom&quot;</code>{" "}
            (also <code>&quot;baseline&quot;</code>). Default is middle. Layout
            tables later use <code>valign=&quot;top&quot;</code> so navigation
            stays at the top of a tall cell.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>

          The <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>{" "}tag places pictures in an HTML document,
          whether they live at a remote URL on the internet or as files in your
          project. Attributes on the tag change <em>what</em>{" "}and <em>how</em>{" "}
          the picture displays. The <code>src</code>{" "}attribute points at the
          file, either a remote URL or a local path. The optional attributes{" "}
          <code>width</code>{" "}and <code>height</code>{" "}set the display size; if
          you provide only one, the other scales proportionally.{" "}
          <code>alt</code>{" "}holds a short text description when the image cannot

        </p>
        <p>
          <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>{" "}is a <strong>void element</strong>: it has
          no body and no closing tag in HTML. In JSX you write it as a
          self-closing tag ending in <code>/&gt;</code>. The same pattern
          applies to other void elements you will meet next, including{" "}
          <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code>{" "}(a line break) and{" "}
          <code>&lt;input /&gt;</code>. Void elements cannot wrap children, so
          attributes carry all of their configuration.

        <p>
          The <code>&lt;form&gt;</code>{" "}tag is different from the static markup
          so far — headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, and images that the
          browser displays. Forms let users <strong>interact</strong>{" "}with the
          interface, in particular to <strong>enter data</strong>{" "}such as a
          username, password, biography, or preferred options. That input is
          what applications later validate, store, or send to a server for long term storage and later retrieval.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following sections present several kinds of input, each in turn:
          text fields, multi-line text areas, radio buttons, checkboxes,
          dropdowns, typed inputs such as email, number, range, and date, and
          buttons that save or cancel. A <code>&lt;form&gt;</code>{" "}wraps those
          controls — <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>,{" "}
          <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;select&gt;</code>,{" "}
          <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>, and related options — so users can fill
          in and submit information as one unit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Until now each Lab 1 topic was a single file next to{" "}
          <code>page.tsx</code>. Forms is a cluster of related components —
          enough that dumping them all in <code>app/labs/lab1/</code>{" "}would
          bury the rest of the lab. Put the form work in its own folder,{" "}
          <code>app/labs/lab1/forms/</code>, so related files sit together and
          the lab folder stays easy to browse. That folder is only for organization:
          do not add a <code>page.tsx</code>{" "}inside it, or Next.js would
          create a <code>/labs/lab1/forms</code>{" "}route. Inside the folder,
          files still import each other the same way (
          <code>import TextFields from &quot;./TextFields&quot;</code>). From{" "}
          <code>page.tsx</code>{" "}you reach one level down:{" "}
          <code>import Forms from &quot;./forms/Forms&quot;</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each form topic lives in its own file under that folder — for example{" "}
          <code>TextFields.tsx</code>, <code>Textarea.tsx</code>, and so on.
          <code>Forms.tsx</code>{" "}assembles them, and <code>page.tsx</code>{" "}
          imports <code>Forms</code>.
        </p>

        <h3

          1.3.6.1 Text Fields
        </h3>
        <p>
          The <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>{" "}tag is the most common way to collect
          short strings such as usernames, passwords, names, and similar values.
        </p>
        <p>
          In React, form fields come in two flavors. An{" "}
          <strong>uncontrolled</strong>{" "}input gets an initial value and then
          the <em>browser</em>{" "}owns what the user types — React does not
          track every keystroke — while a <strong>controlled</strong>{" "}input
          is the opposite: React state holds the current text, and every
          change goes through <code>onChange</code>{" "}so your code stays in
          sync. For these early HTML labs, stay uncontrolled with{" "}
          <code>defaultValue</code>; controlled inputs return when you learn
          state in later chapters — if you set <code>value</code>{" "}without that
          state wiring, the field looks frozen because React keeps forcing the
          same text back onto the input. Later chapters discuss controlled inputs in detail.
        </p>
        <p>Useful attributes include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>id</code> — a unique identifier for the field so CSS,
            JavaScript, and other elements can refer to it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>type</code> — kind of input such as <code>text</code>, <code>password</code>, <code>email</code>, <code>date</code>, <code>number</code>, <code>range</code>, etc.
            The default is <code>text</code> so if you want a simple single-line text, omit it (or use{" "}
            <code>type=&quot;text&quot;</code>).
            Use <code>type=&quot;password&quot;</code>{" "}to mask characters as
            the user types. Later sections introduce other types such as <code>email</code>
            and <code>date</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>placeholder</code> — hint text shown inside an empty field
            (for example <code>jdoe</code>). It disappears when the user starts
            typing and is not submitted as the field&apos;s value.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>title</code> — advisory text, often shown as a tooltip on
            hover. Useful for extra guidance beyond the caption next to the
            field.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>defaultValue</code> — initial text for an uncontrolled
            field; the user can edit freely afterward. Prefer this for this chapter.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>value</code> — current text for a controlled field (paired
            with state and <code>onChange</code>). Skip it for now.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Beside each field, add a <code>&lt;label&gt;</code>{" "}element for the
          visible caption (for example &quot;Username:&quot;). Give the label a{" "}
          <code>htmlFor</code>{" "}attribute whose value matches the input&apos;s{" "}
          <code>id</code>. That links the two. Clicking the label focuses the
          field, and screen readers can announce the connection. In plain HTML
          the attribute is named <code>for</code>; in JSX it must be{" "}
          <code>htmlFor</code>{" "}because <code>for</code>{" "}is a reserved word in
          JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          Associating labels this way is good practice because it enlarges the
          clickable area — especially on small mobile screens, where tapping the
          label text is often easier than hitting a narrow input. Later examples
          with radio buttons and checkboxes make the point even clearer. Their
          controls are tiny, so being able to tap the adjacent label text is a
          real usability win.
        </p>
        <p>
          Create <code>app/labs/lab1/forms/TextFields.tsx</code>{" "}with labeled
          text inputs for username, password, and name fields. The component
          returns a{" "}
          <strong>fragment</strong>{" "}(<code>&lt;&gt;…&lt;/&gt;</code>) — a React
          wrapper that groups several sibling tags without adding an extra{" "}
          <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>{" "}to the DOM:

        <p>
          Try clicking a label to focus its field, hover for{" "}
          <code>title</code>{" "}tooltips, type in the Username field and notice the placeholder text disappears, and notice the password hides its value
          while last name shows the default value <code>Wonderland</code>:

          1.3.6.2 Textarea
        </h3>
        <p>
          Use <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code>{" "}for longer multi-line text such as
          a biography. Unlike the void <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>{" "}(<SectionLink to="1.3.5" /> /
          <SectionLink to="1.3.6.1" />), a textarea is <em>not</em>{" "}void in
          HTML — it has an opening and closing tag, and the browser uses the
          text between those tags as the starting value:
        </p>
        <CodeBlock language="html">{`<textarea id="wd-textarea" cols="30" rows="10">
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...
</textarea>`}</CodeBlock>
        <p>
          That HTML pattern does not carry over to JSX. React models every
          form field the same way it models <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>, so
          the current text is a <strong>prop</strong>{" "}
          (<code>defaultValue</code>{" "}or <code>value</code>), not child
          nodes. Through React 18, body text still rendered and you only got
          a development warning; React 19, which this course uses, throws:{" "}
          <code>
            Use the defaultValue or value props instead of setting children
            on &lt;textarea&gt;
          </code>
          . Put the biography on <code>defaultValue</code>{" "}instead — the same
          idea as on <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>, and what Lab 1 uses.

        <p>
          Create <code>Textarea.tsx</code>{" "}in the same{" "}
          <code>forms</code>{" "}folder, with the <code>cols</code>{" "}and{" "}
          <code>rows</code>{" "}attributes for the visible size:

          same group are <strong>mutually exclusive</strong> — selecting the Comedy option
          clears the Drama option. The browser groups radios that share the same{" "}

          <code>id</code>{" "}(and usually a <code>value</code>{" "}when you submit

          Mutual exclusion applies <strong>within a name group</strong>, not

          Labels work with radios in two common ways. You already used the first:
          keep the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>{" "}and <code>&lt;label&gt;</code>{" "}as
          siblings and connect them with <code>htmlFor</code> / <code>id</code>.
          Alternatively, <strong>wrap</strong>{" "}the input inside the label — then
          you can omit <code>htmlFor</code>{" "}and <code>id</code>, because nesting
          creates the association. Wrapping is compact; separate labels are more

          The <code>&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot;&gt;</code>{" "}tag uses the
          same label pattern as radio buttons, but each box can be selected{" "}
          <strong>independently</strong>. Unlike radios, choosing Comedy does
          not clear Drama — the user can pick several genres at once. Create{" "}

        </h3>
        <p>
          Use <code>&lt;select&gt;</code>{" "}when the user can pick from a fixed
          list of choices. Each choice is rendered as an{" "}
          <code>&lt;option&gt;</code>{" "}inside that list. The text between the
          option tags is what people see (for example &quot;Science Fiction&quot;);
          the <code>value</code>{" "}attribute is what the form actually records
          when that option is selected and is what would be sent to the server.
        </p>
        <p>
          Option <code>value</code>s are typically short{" "}
          <strong>tokens</strong> — stable identifiers that match something in a
          database, an API, or application logic — rather than the display label.
          They are often written in capitals (for example{" "}
          <code>SCIFI</code>, <code>COMEDY</code>) so they read clearly as codes,
          not prose. The visible label can stay human-friendly and even change
          later without breaking stored data.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the <code>&lt;select&gt;</code>{" "}itself, the{" "}
          <code>defaultValue</code>{" "}attribute sets the initial selection
          (uncontrolled, as with text fields). That value must match one of the
          option <code>value</code>s — for example{" "}
          <code>defaultValue=&quot;SCIFI&quot;</code>{" "}selects the Science Fiction
          option. Prefer <code>defaultValue</code>{" "}here; controlled{" "}
          <code>value</code>{" "}+ state comes later.

          <code>&lt;select&gt;</code>. Then{" "}
          <code>defaultValue</code>{" "}(or <code>value</code>) can be an{" "}
          <strong>array</strong>{" "}of tokens — for example{" "}
          <code>{`defaultValue={["COMEDY", "SCIFI"]}`}</code> — so more than one

        </h3>
        <p>
          Plain <code>type=&quot;text&quot;</code>{" "}accepts almost any string. HTML
          also provides <strong>strongly typed</strong>{" "}input types that expect a
          particular kind of data — email addresses, numbers, dates, and more.
          Prefer these when you can. They nudge users toward valid input (and on
          phones often show a specialized keyboard), help the browser validate
          before submit, and reduce mistakes you would otherwise catch only in
          JavaScript later.
        </p>
        <p>
          Build them one at a time in <code>OtherFieldTypes.tsx</code>, then
          import that component into <code>Forms.tsx</code>.
        </p>

        <h4 className="font-sans text-base font-semibold">Email</h4>
        <p>
          Use <code>type=&quot;email&quot;</code>{" "}for email addresses. Browsers
          check for a basic address shape (something like{" "}
          <code>name@domain</code>), and on many mobile devices the on-screen
          keyboard emphasizes <code>@</code>{" "}and <code>.</code>{" "}so typing an
          address is easier than with a full text keyboard.

          optional attributes <code>min</code>{" "}and <code>max</code>{" "}limit the
          allowed range (for example <code>min={"{0}"}</code>{" "}to reject

          incrementing the value.

        <p>
          The <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>{" "}tag gives a form a way to{" "}

          <code>&lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot;&gt;</code>{" "}or{" "}
          <code>&lt;input type=&quot;button&quot;&gt;</code>, because the label
          is nested text (so later you can put an icon inside) and the{" "}

          Those property names (<code>backgroundColor</code>,{" "}

        <p>
          The <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>{" "}tag creates <strong>hyperlinks</strong> —
          the ability to navigate from one document on the Web to another, or to
          a specific place within a document. The{" "}
          <strong>&quot;Hyper&quot;</strong>{" "}in HyperText Markup Language refers
          to that idea. Its <code>href</code>{" "}attribute, short for hypertext
          reference, holds the destination address the browser should load or
          jump to when the user follows the link.
        </p>
        <p>
          The shape of <code>href</code>{" "}matters:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Absolute URL</strong> — a full address including the scheme
            and host, such as{" "}
            <code>https://www.lipsum.com</code>{" "}or{" "}
            <code>https://github.com/…</code>. Use this for other websites.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Relative URL</strong> — a path on the{" "}
            <em>same</em>{" "}site, such as <code>/labs</code>{" "}or{" "}
            <code>/labs/lab1</code>. The browser resolves it against the current
            origin (for example <LocalUrl href="/" />).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Fragment (hash)</strong> — a leading <code>#</code>{" "}plus an
            element <code>id</code>, such as <code>#wd-anchor-bottom</code>.
            That scrolls to a target on the <em>same page</em>{" "}without loading a
            new document. Fragments are classic in-page navigation; they are not
            the same as navigating to a different route.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Optional attributes refine how the link behaves. The{" "}
          <code>target</code>{" "}attribute set to <code>&quot;_blank&quot;</code>{" "}
          opens the destination in a new browser tab or window — useful for
          external sites so users do not lose your app. When you use{" "}
          <code>target=&quot;_blank&quot;</code>, also set{" "}
          <code>rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;</code>{" "}(or at least{" "}
          <code>noopener</code>) so the new page cannot access{" "}
          <code>window.opener</code> — a small but important security habit.

      <Section level={3} id="sec-1-3-10" title="1.3.10 Implementing Navigation">
        <p>
          Recall from the chapter introduction: a{" "}
          <strong>Single Page Application</strong>{" "}(<strong>SPA</strong>) keeps
          one HTML shell loaded and updates the UI as the user moves around,
          instead of downloading a brand-new page for every click. Next.js apps
          are built that way for in-app routes: navigating from Labs to Lab 1
          should feel instant, without flashing a full reload.
        </p>
        <p>
          In <SectionLink to="1.2.5" />{" "}you defined routes by adding <code>page.tsx</code>{" "}files
          under <code>app/</code>{" "}(the App Router). Navigation is how the user{" "}
          <em>moves between</em>{" "}those routes. Historically, some SPAs used the
          URL <strong>hash</strong>{" "}(<code>#/lab1</code>) for client-side
          routes, because changing the fragment does not reload the document.
          That trick enabled early SPA navigation, but it is not how the App
          Router works. Today Next.js uses the browser{" "}
          <strong>History API</strong>{" "}so paths like <code>/labs/lab1</code>{" "}
          update without a full reload — and without requiring a{" "}
          <code>#</code>{" "}prefix. Reserve hash fragments for in-page jumps (as in
          <SectionLink to="1.3.9" />), not for app routes in this course.
        </p>
        <p>
          A plain <code>&lt;a href=&quot;/labs/lab1&quot;&gt;</code>{" "}still works,
          but it tells the browser to treat the click as a normal document
          request. Inside a Next.js app, prefer the built-in{" "}
          <code>Link</code>{" "}component from <code>next/link</code>.{" "}
          <code>Link</code>{" "}renders an anchor under the hood, yet intercepts
          navigation so React can swap in the next route&apos;s UI, prefetch
          linked pages when helpful, and keep client state where appropriate.
          Use <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>{" "}for true external URLs (or when you
          explicitly want a full reload); use <code>Link</code>{" "}for routes you
          already created with <code>page.tsx</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Create Lab 2 and Lab 3 as new App Router routes (
          <code>app/labs/lab2/page.tsx</code>{" "}and{" "}
          <code>app/labs/lab3/page.tsx</code>{" "}— simple headings are enough),
          then a Labs index at <code>app/labs/page.tsx</code>{" "}that links to each
          lab with <code>Link</code>:
        </p>
        <CodeBlock language="tsx" name="Labs" file="app/labs/page.tsx">{`import Link from "next/link";

export default function Labs() {
  return (

      <h1>Labs</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <Link href="/labs/lab1">Lab 1: HTML Examples</Link>
        </li>
        <li>

        <p>
          A Labs index lists Lab 1–3. In the running app, clicking a link
          changes the URL to a path such as <code>/labs/lab1</code>{" "}without the
          full-page flash a raw external <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>{" "}would cause:

          <code>app/labs/lab4/page.tsx</code>{" "}(a simple heading is enough), then
          add a <code>Link</code>{" "}to <code>/labs/lab4</code>{" "}on the Labs
          index. The new route should load without a full page refresh, just

      <Section level={3} id="sec-1-3-11" title="1.3.11 Implementing Layouts">
        <p>
          In the App Router, <code>page.tsx</code>{" "}creates a route (
          <SectionLink to="1.2.5" />
          ); another reserved filename is <code>layout.tsx</code>, which does{" "}
          <em>not</em>{" "}create its own URL by itself. Instead it{" "}
          <strong>wraps</strong>{" "}the <code>page.tsx</code>{" "}
          (and nested layouts) in the same folder and below, so shared chrome —
          navigation, sidebars, headers — belongs in a layout and every child
          route gets it without copying markup into each page.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nested folders nest layouts too. The root{" "}
          <code>app/layout.tsx</code>{" "}wraps the whole app;{" "}
          <code>app/labs/layout.tsx</code>{" "}wraps only routes under{" "}
          <code>/labs</code>. When you open Lab 1, Next.js renders the lab
          layout around the Lab 1 page.
        </p>
        <p>
          Layouts receive a prop named <code>children</code> — the same wrapping
          idea you practiced with <code>HighlightedBox</code>{" "}in <SectionLink to="1.3.8" />. You do
          not pass the page in by hand — the framework renders the matching{" "}
          <code>page.tsx</code>{" "}(and nested UI) into <code>children</code>{" "}for
          you. Create <code>app/labs/TOC.tsx</code>{" "}for a small table of
          contents, then <code>app/labs/layout.tsx</code>{" "}that places the TOC
          beside <code>children</code>:
